    "title": "Nvidia's stock market value rose $273 billion in a day. How it rose to AI prominence, by the numbers",
    "body": "Nvidia's stock price jumped 16% on Thursday, increasing the company's market value by a staggering $273 billion in just one day, a record amount.\n\nThe chipmaker has been seeing soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence, or AI applications. The company's revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nIt's the latest sign that the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence likely won't subside anytime soon. Nvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look:\n\nThe amount Nvidia Corp.'s market value increased on Thursday alone, according to FactSet. The previous record one-day jump was Meta Platform's gain of $205 billion on Feb. 2 of this year. In other words, Nvidia's one-day gain is more than the total market values of market stalwarts Bank of America ($265 billion) and Coca-Cola ($263 billion). In all, just 26 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 have market caps above $273 billion, including Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's total market value as of the close of trading Thursday. It recently passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable public company, behind Microsoft ($3.051 trillion) and Apple ($2.845 trillion). The company was valued at around $580 billion a year ago.\n\nRevenue for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28, more than double Nvidia's revenue for 2022 and about 6 times what it was five years ago. Wall Street expects Nvidia's revenue to top $100 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\nThat's Nvidia's net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, almost 50 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple's net margin is 25.3% and Microsoft's is 34.1%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however.",

    "title": "D%: How USC, behind assistant Beth Burns, has created its own defensive metric",
    "body": "LOS ANGELES - Rayah Marshall grinned as if she were the keeper of a kingdom's tactics, backpedaling quickly away from a question about customs that have buoyed the USC women's basketball team's recent defensive surge.\n\n\"The defensive goal chart,\" Marshall said, walking away after Thursday's practice, flinging morsels of information over her shoulder with a smirk in her voice. \"If you know, you know. That's all I could say about that.\"\n\nThis is USC's best-kept secret. Except it's hardly a secret if you spend a minute with Beth Burns, USC's defensive guru and Lindsay Gottlieb's right-hand woman, who has implemented and popularized her own system of subjective defensive analytics - this \"goal chart\" - that the entire program has bought into.\n\nBack during her second stint from 2005-2013 as the head coach of San Diego State, Burns and the Aztecs took a trip up to play Saint Mary's. Burns knew longtime Saint Mary's men's coach Randy Bennett from his early coaching days at the University of San Diego; as such, Bennett offered to let Burns and her staff shower in the men's locker room before they returned home. And in the locker room, Bennett's whiteboard caught Burns' eye: scrawled with figures and words like defensive percentage.\n\nBurns, for long years, had mulled the lack of empirical data available to measure defense. From basketball's beginning of time, she explained with youthful enthusiasm Thursday, it was easy for players to empirically digest offensive performance: shoot 1-for-14, you played bad. Defense, she continued, was \"more just, your coach saying, 'You stink.'\"\n\nSo when San Diego State returned home, Burns called Bennett, and asked him about the system on his whiteboard. It provided the seeds for a defensive metric system that Burns has morphed and developed across the recent years of her coaching career, first bringing it to Louisville, then back to USC.\n\nEvery Tuesday, Burns breaks down video clips of every single possession in which an opposing team scored to USC players, assigning them a certain number of points and an efficiency score derived from a simple formula. It has worked wonders for a USC program that now sits at 20-4 and seventh in the AP Top 25, shooting up to second-place tie in the Pac-12 after a six-game conference win streak. Freshman JuJu Watkins' offensive explosions have been deservedly well-documented; USC, though, has hit its stride in large part because of swarming defensive effort, Watkins shooting a near-unholy 6-for-32 at Oregon State last Sunday and the Trojans still fighting to a win by holding the Beavers to 33% shooting.\n\n\"This is the secret sauce of it,\" Burns smiled Thursday, getting ready to explain her system.\n\nHere are the specifics. On plays where an opponent scores, Burns assigns those points to the USC defender or defenders directly responsible under the Trojans' defensive scheme. Say a perimeter defender was supposed to force someone baseline, and they went middle for a layup - Burns assigns that defender two points. Say a big doesn't box out and it turns into a three - Burns assigns that big three points.\n\nIndividual points, then, are compiled into a simple equation: points divided by minutes played, for a stat Burns calls simply \"D%.\" Anyone with a score of 29% or lower (which, if prorated to an entire team's output, would lead to 60 points or less being surrendered), Burns defines as being in the \"green\" zone. Anyone 39% or lower, in the yellow zone. Anyone above 39%, in the red zone.\n\n\"And you do not want to be red,\" Burns grinned.\n\nAcross the last three games, half of USC's roster has been in the green. Players have become accustomed, Burns said, to coming into film sessions, watching their mistakes, and bickering with her over their scores. The program, Gottlieb said Thursday, has improved in their understanding of defensive coverages, a trend that shows both in simple stats - USC hasn't surrendered more than 70 points since mid-January - and in Burns' metrics. As Burns sat in a baseline seat after Thursday's practice, she stopped an exiting Kayla Padilla for a moment, gushing in awe over the senior's game Feb. 12 against Arizona in which Padilla wasn't tabbed for any points on Burns' system.\n\n\"I've been doing this chart a long time, buddy, and I don't know anyone's done a 0 in 30 minutes,\" Burns said, Padilla placing her hand over her heart with a smile.\n\n\"Thanks, Coach B,\" Padilla responded.\n\nThe metric has spilled outside of practice courts and film rooms, Burns discussing Padilla's score excitedly with senior McKenzie Forbes in a Galen hallway long after practice wrapped up Thursday, the foundation of a program approach that has seen widespread individual defensive improvement. There's Watkins, who racks up deflections nearly as frequently as she does points. There's Marshall, who Gottlieb praised as \"quarterbacking\" USC's defense from the paint. There's Padilla, who's taken personal pride in her ascension from a score-first guard at Penn to a point-of-attack defender at USC.\n\n\"When you're playing, sometimes, it's like, 'Ope -- well, that's another two points on the D-chart,'\" Padilla said.",

    "title": "4 alleged weapons smugglers tied to deaths of 2 Navy SEALs brought to U.S. to face charges",
    "body": "Washington -- Four foreign nationals who were allegedly transporting Iranian-made weapons on a vessel that two U.S. Navy SEALs drowned trying to board have been brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges, making their first appearance in court on Thursday.\n\nThe defendants -- Muhammad Pahlawan, Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufran Ullah and Izhar Muhammad -- were taken into custody when a U.S. Navy ship intercepted their small boat in the Arabian Sea on Jan. 11. The vessel, or dhow, was allegedly destined for Yemen.\n\nA team of SEALs from the USS Lewis Puller and a U.S. Coast Guard response team boarded the unflagged boat in a nighttime raid and seized \"what is believed to be Iranian-made advanced conventional weaponry,\" according to charging documents unsealed Thursday. A total of 14 crew members were on board. In addition to the four co-defendants, eight of the remaining 10 witnesses are also in U.S. custody.\n\nProsecutors wrote that the vessel was transporting \"propulsion and guidance components\" for medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, as well as a warhead. The weapons were likely intended for Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have attacked dozens of commercial and military vessels in recent months, according to investigators.\n\nTwo of the SEALs -- Special Warfare Operators Christopher Chambers and Nathan Ingram -- were lost at sea during the mission. Defense officials told CBS News at the time that they fell overboard in rough seas while trying to board the dhow. After a 10-day search, the military declared the two SEALs deceased.\n\nNone of the defendants have been charged directly with the SEALs' deaths. According to prosecutors, Pakistani identification cards matching their names were found onboard their boat.\n\nThe seizure was the first time the U.S. military intercepted weapons from Iran destined for the Houthis since the rebel group ramped up their attacks on commercial shipping and international warships in the Red Sea in November 2023.\n\nAccording to court papers, all of the crewmembers denied smuggling the weapons once they were in custody, though a few admitted to being drug smugglers. Other crew members identified Pahlawan as the leader of the group. He said he had been in Iran for two years and that the ship left Iran six days before it was intercepted by the Navy.\n\nPahlawan said the ship's Iranian owner gave him a satellite phone to communicate while at sea. Investigators said the phone received calls from a number associated with a member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite branch of the country's military.\n\nU.S. investigators said that the ship originated in Iran on a route that included a stop in Somalia. The path was \"consistent with other weapons smuggling operations,\" the government said.\n\nThe FBI and NCIS twice interviewed Pahlawan. He denied being the captain of the boat or knowing about the weaponry, but admitted to being the senior sailor onboard.\n\n\"Two crew members indicated that Pahlawan told crewmembers not to stop the [boat] while the Navy was approaching the dhow,\" according to charging documents. \"At least one crewmember said that [Pahlawan] tried to make the dhow go faster when the Navy was approaching. Multiple crewmembers said it was another crewmember, and not [Pahlawan], who stopped the boat.\"\n\nThe other three defendants also denied knowing about the weapons on the ship. They are charged with providing materially false information to investigators.\n\nPahlawan faces that charge, plus one count of intentionally and unlawfully transporting explosive material on a ship, knowing it would be used to cause harm.\n\n\"Due to the publicity of the war in Israel and the Houthis' attacks on vessels in the Red Sea as a means of protesting the United States' support of Israel and as a means of supporting Hamas and Palestine ... there is probable cause to believe that Pahlawan knew that the weaponry would be used by the Houthis against American and/or Israeli targets or interests,\" prosecutors alleged Thursday.\n\nHe faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\nThe four defendants and eight of the witnesses who were aboard the small boat made their initial appearances in federal court in Virginia on Thursday, the Justice Department said.\n\n\"The Justice Department extends our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the two Navy SEALs who lost their lives on January 11th while conducting an operation in the Arabian Sea,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"The charges resulting from that interdiction make clear that the Justice Department will use every legal authority to hold accountable those who facilitate the flow of weapons from Iran to Houthi rebel forces, Hamas, and other groups that endanger the security of the United States and our allies.\"\n\nHouthi rebels have now attacked or threatened ships in the Red Sea at least 60 times since November 2023, according to a defense official. The strikes are in response to ongoing war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began after Hamas' attacks across Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nThe U.S. military has since conducted roughly 30 defensive strikes targeting the Houthis, according to the Pentagon.",

    "title": "Eldorado Announces 2024 Detailed Production & Cost Guidance; Provides Four-Year Growth Profile",
    "body": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 22, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eldorado Gold Corporation (\"Eldorado\" or the \"Company\") provides detailed 2024 production and cost guidance and four-year production outlook. All financial figures stated within this release are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n2024 Guidance Highlights\n\nGold production of 505,000 to 555,000 ounces, representing a 9% increase from 2023 gold production (assuming the mid-point of the range).Total cash costs(1) of $840 to $940 per ounce sold.All-in sustaining costs(1) (\"AISC\") of $1,190 to $1,290 per ounce sold.Growth capital(1) of $497 to $569 million, including $375 to $425 million towards the advancement of the Skouries project.Sustaining capital(1) of $135 to $160 million.Exploration expenditures of $27 to $30 million, focused on resource conversion drilling at the Lamaque Complex and Efemcukuru, resource growth and discovery programs in Quebec, Turkiye and Greece.\n\n(1) These financial measures are non-IFRS financial measures. Certain additional disclosures for non-IFRS financial measures and ratios have been incorporated by reference, and additional detail can be found at the end of this press release and in the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' of Eldorado's December 31, 2023 MD&A.\n\n\"We have a lot of momentum as we step into 2024,\" said George Burns, Eldorado's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"A number of key initiatives were completed last year that set up our operations for long-term efficient, safe and growing production. At Olympias, we made tremendous progress, positioning it to deliver increased metal production and lower costs as we push development in the Flats zone. At Kisladag, we continue to optimize the agglomeration circuit to maintain consistent permeability as the material is stacked on the pads. It's also an exciting year at Lamaque, as we will advance the Ormaque deposit through the mining and processing of a bulk sample leading to an expected inaugural reserve late this year.\"\n\n\"In addition, we made significant headway on our Skouries project as we ramped up into full construction. This year we expect to make substantial progress as we finalize the remaining contracts, advance construction of the major earth works including haul roads, the Integrated Extractive Waste Management Facility, water management facilities, and the crusher and filter buildings. We also expect work to continue to advance on the underground with a focus on lateral development and associated services for the year to setup mining of two test stopes in 2025.\"\n\n\"Our four-year production guidance is designed to provide an outlook as to how we see our current operations performing and the impact of the ramp-up of Skouries production in 2026 through 2027. Next year, to move in-line with peer companies, we will transition to providing three-year production guidance by mine,\" added Burns.\n\n2024 Guidance Lamaque\n\nComplexKisladagEfemcukuru(3)Olympias(3,4)Skouries\n\nProjectTotal2023\n\nActualGold Production (000' oz)175 - 190180 - 19575 - 8575 - 85 505 - 555485Silver Production (000' oz) 1,500 - 1,700 1,500 - 1,7001,382Lead Production (000' t) 13 - 16 13 - 1612Zinc Production (000' t) 12 - 15 12 - 1514Tonnes Processed (millions)0.87 - 0.9113.2 - 13.70.53 - 0.550.48 - 0.51 Gold Grade (g/t)6.3 - 6.80.7 - 0.85.0 - 5.58.0 - 9.0 Total Cash Costs(1) ($/oz sold)700 - 800820 - 9201,080 - 1,180980 - 1,080 840 - 940(5)850All-in Sustaining Costs(1) ($/oz sold)1,180 - 1,280890 - 9901,290 - 1,3901,280 - 1,380 1,190 - 1,290(5)1,220Capital Expenditures ($ millions) Sustaining Capital(1)85 - 9510 - 1512 - 1728 - 33 135 - 160136Growth Capital(1,2)17 - 2285 - 956 - 914 - 18375 - 425497 - 569275Sustaining and Growth Capital(1,2) ($ millions)102 - 11795 - 11018 - 2642 - 51375 - 425632 - 729411\n\n(1) These financial measures are non-IFRS financial measures. Certain additional disclosures for non-IFRS financial measures and ratios have been incorporated by reference and additional detail can be found at the end of this press release and in the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' of Eldorado's December 31, 2023 MD&A.\n\n(2) Includes capitalized exploration at Lamaque and Efemcukuru.\n\n(3) Payable metal produced.\n\n(4) Olympias by-product grades: Silver: 120-130 g/t; Zinc: 4.2-4.7%; Lead: 3.8-4.3%.\n\n(5) Totals may not add based on the averaging of costs.\n\nGold production in 2024 is expected to be between 505,000 to 555,000 ounces, a 9% increase from 2023 gold production (based on the mid-point of the range). The increase in gold production is primarily driven by higher expected production at Kisladag as a result of the upgraded materials handling systems and the recently commissioned North Heap Leach Pad. In addition, we expect an increase at Olympias following the underground infrastructure upgrades completed in mid-2023 and productivity improvements that ramped-up during 2023. Similar to prior years, quarter-to-quarter gold production in 2024 is expected to fluctuate, with higher production expected in the second half due to the impact of winter conditions at Kisladag and ore grade variability across the portfolio.\n\nTotal cash costs and all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") are expected to be relatively stable compared to 2023, with average total cash costs(1) in 2024 expected to be between $840 to $940 per ounce sold and an average AISC(1) of $1,190 to $1,290 per ounce sold. The expected 2024 costs, relative to 2023 cost performance, are driven by forecasted lower unit costs for fuel and other key consumables, and slightly offset by higher labour costs in some areas.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenses are expected to be $27 to $30 million in 2024, with 65% expensed, and 35% capitalized. General and administrative expenses are expected to be $35 to $38 million in 2024, and depreciation expense expected to range from $280 to $290 million.\n\n(1) Total cash cost per ounce sold and AISC per ounce sold are non-IFRS financial measures. Certain additional disclosures for non-IFRS financial measures and ratios have been incorporated by reference, and additional detail can be found at the end of this press release and in the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' of Eldorado's December 31, 2023, MD&A.\n\nOPERATING MINES:\n\nCANADA\n\nLamaque Complex\n\nIn 2024, production guidance of 175,000 to 190,000 ounces at the Lamaque Complex is consistent with the previously guided range of 180,000 to 190,000 ounces. The range has been widened slightly to reflect an updated mine plan that supports mine sequencing optionality and optimization as we move lower in the deposit. In 2024, the focus remains on resource conversion drilling at Ormaque, the completion of a bulk sample and a pre-feasibility study with the expectation of declaring an inaugural reserve at the end of the year.\n\nTotal cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be slightly higher compared to 2023, as a result of an increase in the use of consumables (fuel, cyanide, explosives) and increased labour costs.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures of $85 to $95 million for 2024 are expected to include significant underground mine development and resource conversion drilling at the Triangle deposit. Expected growth capital of $17 to $22 million for 2024 includes non-sustaining exploration expenditures for resource conversion and resource expansion drilling at the Ormaque deposit, tailings management, and electric underground trucks.\n\nTURKIYE\n\nKisladag\n\nIn 2024, production guidance of 180,000 to 195,000 ounces at Kisladag is slightly lower than the previously guided range of 195,000 to 205,000 ounces, primarily due to the inventory build-up within the ore stacked in the leach facility, following the residual impacts of the high precipitation event in 2023. We continue to optimize our on-belt agglomeration and stacking processes to improve quality and consistency of stacked ore, along with focused activities to enhance inventory drawdown.\n\nGold production in 2024 is expected to increase 21% from 2023 production, driven by higher ore grades, higher tonnage resulting from the upgraded materials handling circuit, and inventory drawdown. The recently commissioned North Heap Leach Pad and increased irrigation rates contribute to improved leach kinetics. Additional efficiencies will be realized with the completion and commissioning of the north adsorption-desorption and recovery plant in the second half of 2024.\n\nTotal cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be slightly higher, when compared to 2023, driven primarily by higher mining rates and increased labour costs. Consumption of fuel, explosives, cement, and cyanide are also expected to increase, impacting absolute costs.\n\nPlanned 2024 sustaining capital of $10 to $15 million is primarily related to equipment overhauls and processing improvements. Planned 2024 growth capital of $85 to $95 million includes the continuation of the waste stripping campaign, the phased expansion of the North Heap Leach Pad, and the north adsorption-desorption and recovery plant construction.\n\nEfemcukuru\n\nIn 2024, production guidance of 75,000 to 85,000 ounces is unchanged from the previously guided range. Total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be higher, when compared to 2023, and reflect increases in labour costs, and consumable costs.\n\nPlanned sustaining capital expenditures of $12 to $17 million for 2024 include underground development and equipment overhauls. Planned growth capital of $6 to $9 million for 2024 is expected to be primarily based on development and infrastructure for expansion of the mining area towards the Kokarpinar and Bati vein systems.\n\nAn updated technical report will be filed at the end of Q1 2024.\n\nGREECE\n\nOlympias\n\nIn 2024, production guidance of 75,000 to 85,000 ounces at Olympias increased 14% from the previously guided range of 65,000 to 75,000 ounces, primarily driven by the results of productivity initiatives implemented over the past few years, including increased ventilation capacity, bulk emulsion explosives, and productivity improvements at the mine and the mill.\n\nTotal cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce sold are expected to be lower compared to 2023, supported by increased production and throughput and higher by-product credits for silver, lead and zinc production and lower costs for certain consumables. Continued quarter to quarter variability in AISC and total cash costs due to by-product credits from timing on by-product concentrate shipments is expected.\n\nPlanned 2024 sustaining capital expenditures of $28 to $33 million include underground mine development and management of the Kokkinolakas tailings management facility. Planned 2024 growth capital of $14 to $18 million is primarily focused around mill expansion to support ramp-up to 650 ktpa and upgrading of ancillary facilities.\n\nAn updated technical report will be filed at the end of Q1 2024.\n\nGROWTH CAPITAL INVESTMENTS:\n\nSkouries\n\nProject spending at Skouries in 2024 of between $375 and $425 million will be focused on advancing the construction of the major earthworks structures including the haul roads, Integrated Extractive Waste Management Facility (\"IEWMF\") construction, low-grade stockpile, water management, process facilities, crusher building and filter building. In addition, work will focus on underground development to support test stope mining in 2025. Mechanical, piping and electrical installations will also progress in all process and infrastructure areas.\n\nOn the critical path is the filter plant building, which continues to advance, with the piling work having commenced. In Q2 2024, it is expected that the filter building contract will be awarded which will include the building structure, assembly of equipment within the building, comprising air compressors, conveyors, filter presses and other ancillary equipment, in addition to the piping and electrical work. The filter press plates arrived on site in Q1 2024 with the frames for supporting the filter press plates fabricated and expected to ship in Q2 2024. Preassembly is expected to start in Q2 2024.\n\nWork for the mill / flotation building is in progress with commissioning work on overhead cranes, installation of construction lighting and scaffolding, and the commencement of structural steel work. Mobilization for the process plant mechanical, piping and electrical work will start in Q1 2024.\n\nBy the end of 2024, we expect to have completed the IEWMF coffer dam and significantly advanced the IEWMF earthworks, water management facilities, process plant and filter plants.\n\nThe first phase of underground development continues to advance the West Decline and access to the test stopes with a local contractor. The second underground development contract proposals are in the final evaluation stage, awarding of the contract is planned for the end of Q2 2024. This contract includes the test stope work as well as additional development and services work to support the development of the underground mine. We expect to complete approximately 2,200 metres of underground development in 2024.\n\nThe time we invested in diligently negotiating the key project contracts has increased our execution confidence with a modest effect on the production schedule. First production is now expected in Q3 2025 from prior guidance of mid-2025. We expect a steep ramp up curve over the second half of 2025 and remain on track for commercial production at the end of 2025. With a back end weighted ramp-up curve we expect to produce a lower amount of high-quality copper-gold concentrate in 2024. This has resulted in a lowered gold production range to between 50,000 to 60,000 ounces from prior guidance of 80,000 to 90,000 ounces. We also expect to produce between 15 to 20 million pounds of copper in 2025. We are assessing our plans with the goal of increasing our 2026 gold and copper production profile at Skouries.\n\nThe estimated capital to complete construction has increased 9% to $920 million from $845 million as detailed in our 2023 Year-End and Fourth Quarter Financial and Operational Results.\n\n2024 EXPLORATION OUTLOOK\n\nEldorado Gold's exploration activities in 2024 are focused on the regions in which we operate: Canada, Turkiye and Greece, and includes in-mine resource conversion and expansion drilling, drill testing a range of near-mine and early-stage targets, as well as generating new targets and projects through generative initiatives. Global exploration expenditures planned for 2024 are $27 to $30 million, with an additional $8 to $10 million of non-sustaining exploration expenditures to support Ormaque resource conversion and expansion drilling at the Lamaque Complex and conversion and expansion drilling at the Kokarpinar vein at Efemcukuru. Across the portfolio, approximately 196,000 metres of drilling are planned, and includes approximately 43,000 metres of resource conversion and extension drilling at Lamaque Operations (Triangle), Efemcukuru (Kestanebeleni) and Olympias planned as capitalised sustaining, ~63,000 metres of resource conversion and extension drilling at Lamaque Operations (Ormaque) and Efemcukuru (Kokarpinar) planned as capitalised growth budget. In addition, over 90,000 metres of drilling are planned to test early stage targets across the portfolio and are expensed.\n\nCANADA\n\nLamaque Complex and Near Mine Exploration\n\nTriangle Mine: Resource expansion and resource conversion drilling at the Triangle Mine will focus on the C6 and C7 zones with approximately 26,000 metres planned. A new exploration drive and drill platform at the 785 level will enable shorter holes and improved angles for resource conversion purposes.\n\nOrmaque Deposit: The 2024 exploration program at Ormaque is expected to include approximately 35,000 metres of underground resource conversion drilling within existing inferred resources. This drilling will continue to test the upper two-thirds of the deposit for further conversion from inferred to indicated resource (down to lens E100). In addition, approximately 18,000 metres of surface drilling testing step-outs to the east of and below the known deposit is planned.\n\nSigma-Lamaque early-stage targets: Approximately 13,000 metres of underground exploration drilling planned from platforms along the Sigma-Triangle decline, testing multiple conceptual targets and step-outs from previous high-grade drill intercepts in the Sigma-Lamaque-Ormaque area. In addition, approximately 19,000 metres of surface drilling is planned to test targets in the same area but away from the decline. The drilling will target high-grade vein systems similar in geological setting and mineralization style to those historically mined at both Sigma and Lamaque, including testing new conceptual targets that have been developed in recent years.\n\nVal d'Or exploration: We are advancing multiple early to advanced-stage exploration targets in the Val-d'Or district that are expected to provide opportunities for resource growth for the Lamaque Complex. Over 30,000 metres of drilling is planned on targets that include:\n\nBourlamaque early-stage targets: Approximately 5,000 metres of surface drilling is planned to test various early-stage targets mainly within the Bourlamaque Batholith, which have been defined by a combination of historical drilling results, geophysical anomalies, till geochemistry, and geological mapping. The drilling is expected to target high-grade vein systems similar in geological setting and mineralization style to those historically mined at the Beaufor mine and the mines in the Herbin area.\n\nUniacke-Perestroika: The Uniake-Perestroika properties, located approximately 45 kilometres northeast of the Lamaque Complex, are being explored under an option agreement with Val d'Or Mining. Approximately 6,500 metres of drilling are planned to test a target that has been developed in the Héva-Cadillac area.\n\nAbitibi Exploration\n\nEldorado Gold's early-stage exploration in Canada is currently focused on generating and testing target areas within the greater Abitibi region that offer opportunities for standalone development outside of the Lamaque Complex area. The Company's current exploration portfolio includes the Montgolfier project located along the Harricana-Turgeon greenstone belt to the east of the Casa Berardi mine, and a group of licenses in the Kirkland Lake belt currently being explored under an option agreement with the license holder Val-d'Or Mining Corp. At Montgolfier, a staged diamond drill program of up to 8,000 metres is currently underway, testing for the bedrock source of highly anomalous gold-in-till anomalies identified in a previous sonic drilling program, elevated concentrations of gold intercepted in the 2023 initial drill testing program, as well as integrated lithological structural and geophysical targets. The Kirkland Lake licenses are at the target definition stage, and targeting reviews are underway to assess if targets are appropriate for drill testing in 2024, where approximately 3,500 metres have been planned.\n\nTURKIYE\n\n2024 exploration in Turkiye is focused on resource expansion and resource conversion drilling at Efemcukuru and advancing several early-stage projects in highly prospective priority regions throughout Turkiye.\n\nEfemcukuru\n\nDuring 2024, approximately 10,000 metres of resource conversion and expansion drilling is planned at the Kokarpinar South vein system and approximately 8,000 metres are planned for the South Ore and North Ore Shoots at the Kestanebeleni vein system. Approximately 23,000 metres of drilling is also to test earlier stage targets in the West Vein area, with the main focus on the Volcan and Huseyinburnu vein systems. Geologic mapping and geophysical surveys are also planned as part of assessing the wider exploration potential on existing licenses.\n\nEarly-Stage Exploration\n\nWe continue to explore regions of Turkiye that offer strong exploration potential for resource exploration and development. Current programs are focused in the Artvin (Hod Maden) district and along the Izmir-Ankara Suture Zone, where approximately 12,500 metres of drilling are planned for 2024 to test early-stage targets. Project generation activities and early-stage project work within the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex are also being conducted with a Turkish joint venture partner.\n\nGREECE\n\nExploration activities in Greece in 2024 are focused in supporting drill program execution at the Olympias mine and at the Skouries project, in addition to undertaking basic field activities to define targets for future drill testing across our exploration licenses.\n\nOlympias\n\nApproximately 9,000 metres of surface drilling is planned to test for extensions to known mineralization in the East, West (Flats) and North Zones at Olympias.\n\nFour-Year Outlook Overview:\n\nGold production of 675,000 to 735,000 ounces by 2027, resulting in growth of 45% over the four-year period from 2023 production and a compound annual growth rate of over 9%.Continued strong commitment to exploration to unlock the outstanding potential of the Company's brownfields property portfolio and identifying and developing new opportunities in Eldorado's focus jurisdictions.Skouries first production in Q3 2025, with commercial production by the end of 2025.\n\n20242025(2)202620272023 ActualGold Production (000' oz)Lamaque Complex175 - 190(1)170 - 180180 - 200180 - 200177Kisladag180 - 195175 - 185150 - 165165 - 175155Efemcukuru75 - 8570 - 8075 - 8560 - 7086Olympias75 - 8580 - 9080 - 9075 - 8567Skouries 50 - 60(2)145 - 155195 - 205 Total Gold Production (000 oz)505 - 555545 - 595630 - 695675 - 735485Copper Production (Mlbs)Skouries 15 - 2050 - 6060 - 80 Total Copper Production (Mlbs) 15 - 2050 - 6060 - 80\n\n(1) Includes production ounces from the bulk sample process at Ormaque.\n\n(2) Includes expected pre-commercial production from Skouries.

    "title": "Rosenblatt sets $15 stock target for Adeia, cites strong profitability By Investing.com",
    "body": "On Thursday, Rosenblatt initiated coverage on Adeia Inc. (NASDAQ: ADEA) with a Buy rating and a price target of $15.00. The firm highlighted Adeia's impressive profitability profile and growth potential in media and semiconductor intellectual property (IP). Adeia's media IP portfolio is considered essential for a wide range of video platforms, including Pay-TV, over-the-top (OTT) services, social media, consumer electronics, and emerging adjacent markets.\n\nThe coverage points to Adeia's semiconductor technologies as a key driver for performance gains and cost reductions akin to Moore's Law. With the limits of Moore's Law in sight, Adeia's advancements are expected to gain wider adoption in the semiconductor industry. Rosenblatt's analysis suggests that Adeia's stock is currently undervalued, trading at eight times next twelve months (NTM) earnings, despite the company's potential for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5% over the next five years, with an operating margin above 60%.\n\nThe firm believes that Adeia's shares have not received the attention they deserve from investors following its spin-off from Xperi (NASDAQ:ADEA) in October 2022. Rosenblatt recommends investors to take note of Adeia, which it refers to as a \"30-year-old start-up,\" as the company is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing transition of video to new platforms and the increasing demand for high-performance semiconductors. Adeia's robust technology offerings and financial metrics underpin this positive outlook.\n\nAs Rosenblatt initiates coverage on Adeia Inc. (NASDAQ: ADEA) with a bullish stance, real-time data from InvestingPro bolsters the firm's optimistic outlook. With a market capitalization of $1.18 billion USD, Adeia's valuation reflects a combination of solid fundamentals and growth potential. The company's P/E ratio stands at 17.52, with an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q4 2023 at a slightly lower 15.71, indicating a potentially undervalued stock relative to its earnings.\n\nInvestingPro Tips suggest that Adeia's attractiveness to investors is further enhanced by its high shareholder yield and a PEG ratio of just 0.15 for the same period, which aligns with Rosenblatt's view of the stock being undervalued. Moreover, the company's strong free cash flow yield is implied by its valuation, making it an even more compelling investment opportunity.\n\nOne of the most striking data points is Adeia's robust return of 20.9% over the last three months, reinforcing the notion that the stock has been performing well in the short term. For those looking for longer-term performance indicators, the company has also shown a strong return over the last five years.

    "title": "Coherus BioSciences expands board, appoints new director By Investing.com",
    "body": "Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRS) announced the expansion of its Board of Directors from nine to ten members and the appointment of Georgia Erbez as a Class III director. The decision, made by the company's Board on Monday, will have Ms. Erbez serve until the 2026 annual meeting of stockholders, unless she leaves her position earlier due to resignation, removal, or death.\n\nThe appointment follows a recommendation from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and is part of Coherus BioSciences' ongoing efforts to strengthen its corporate governance. In addition to her role as director, Ms. Erbez has been appointed to serve on the audit committee of the Board.\n\nMs. Erbez brings a wealth of experience to Coherus BioSciences, having held various financial and strategic positions in the industry. Her expertise is expected to be a valuable asset to the Board, particularly on the audit committee where financial oversight is crucial.\n\nThis strategic move by Coherus BioSciences comes as the company continues to navigate the competitive biotechnology sector, where effective governance and strategic planning are key to success. The expansion of the Board is a common practice for growing companies seeking to diversify their expertise and decision-making capabilities.\n\nInvestors and stakeholders of Coherus BioSciences may view this appointment as a positive step towards enhancing the company's governance structure and oversight. The addition of Ms. Erbez is seen as a reinforcement of the company's commitment to strong corporate governance practices.\n\nThis announcement is based on a press release statement from Coherus BioSciences and reflects the company's latest steps in corporate governance and strategic board management.\n\nAs Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRS) fortifies its Board of Directors with the appointment of Georgia Erbez, a closer look at the company's financial health and market performance through InvestingPro data reveals a mixed picture. With a market capitalization of $275.07 million, Coherus has been navigating the biotech industry's competitive landscape, reflected in the company's significant debt burden and rapid cash burn, as highlighted by InvestingPro Tips.\n\nThe company's financial metrics indicate challenges ahead. The P/E ratio stands at a negative -0.97, with an adjusted P/E ratio for the last twelve months as of Q3 2023 at -1.43, suggesting that investors are concerned about the company's profitability. This is further underscored by the fact that analysts have revised their earnings downwards for the upcoming period and do not anticipate Coherus will be profitable this year. Additionally, the company's stock has experienced volatility with a significant drop over the last six months, though it has shown a strong return over the past three months.\n\nDespite these challenges, Coherus has demonstrated a robust gross profit margin of 70.33% for the same period, indicating effective cost management relative to revenue. Nevertheless, with the company not paying dividends to shareholders and the valuation implying a poor free cash flow yield, investors may need to exercise caution.\n\nFor those looking to delve deeper into Coherus BioSciences' financials and performance, InvestingPro offers additional insights and metrics. There are 9 more InvestingPro Tips available, which can provide further guidance on the company's outlook.

The shares rose as much as 8.1% in Toronto.\n\nFor the full year in 2023, Gildan's earnings per share fell 17%, partly because it saw a drop in activewear sales, its most important segment.\n\nAds\n\nGildan's board is involved in a nasty dispute with several institutional shareholders and former Chief Executive Officer Glenn Chamandy, who was sacked in December over disagreements about the company's succession plan and strategy. Some of its largest investors, led by Browning West LP, are trying to vote out the board and reinstate Chamandy. The matter may be decided at a shareholder meeting scheduled for May 28.\n\nThe company warned analysts at the start of Wednesday's conference call that executives would only answer questions about the financial results.\n\nLast year was \"a year of strong progress on Gildan's sustainable growth strategy despite an overall challenging macroeconomic backdrop,\" Vince Tyra, the new CEO, said on the call. \"This foundation, together with a solid balance sheet, puts us in an enviable position.\"\n\nGildan is projecting revenue growth will be \"flat to up low-single digits\" in 2024 as the industry is impacted by soft demand, Chief Financial Officer Rhodri Harries told analysts. Its corporate tax rate might jump because of regulatory changes, the company said, but earnings per share should increase more than 13% and free cash flow should rise over last year's levels.\n\n\"Gildan is at an inflection point with its earnings profile, and should see attractive upside to the share price should the CEO succession resolution come to fruition in a manner in the best interest of all stakeholders,\" TD Cowen analyst Brian Morrison said in a note to investors.\n\nRead more on the Gildan governance battle\n\nThe dismissal of Chamandy in December led to $6.3 million in expenses, including termination costs and advisory and legal fees for \"shareholder matters.\"\n\nWhen asked about long-term growth opportunities, Tyra said a strategy would come this year, and would be focused on \"tweaks and enhancement\" -- such as leveraging the American Apparel brand -- and organic growth.\n\nGildan was up nearly 4% to C$47.59 as of 10:48 a.m. in Toronto, the highest since Dec. 8 -- the last trading day before Chamandy was ousted.\n\nCopyright Bloomberg\n\nTags : Fashion Ready-to-wear Business",

Analysts expected a rise of 1.3% to $4.09 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nRetailers have also banked on deeper discounts and promotions to appeal to bargain-hunting customers, further increasing competition for Etsy, and putting sellers at its two-sided marketplace at a disadvantage.\n\nIn response, Etsy has been working towards aiding its sellers on marketing, and has also been investing in testing promotions across its site to attract more buyers.\n\nHowever, this took a toll on the company's margins in the fourth quarter, which fell 370 basis points to 9.9%. In the prior quarter, it reported net income margin of 13.8%.\n\nThe company has banked on cost reduction initiatives, including a recent plan to cut its workforce, to help ease the hit from soft demand for crafts supplies and home decor items, which has lagged a pandemic boom.\n\nIts holiday-quarter revenue rose 4.3% to $842.3 million and beat analysts' expectations of $827.8 million, with the company saying that GMS rose 4% year-over-year in the key Cyber Week shopping period last year.\n\nRachel Wolff, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, said the \"mixed\" results suggested that Etsy was struggling to keep pace with larger ecommerce players while tackling \"strong competition\" from low-cost competitors like Temu.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2024 All rights reserved.\n\nTags : Fashion Miscellaneous Business",

    "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. - SPX Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:SPXC), a diversified global supplier of highly engineered products, reported a slight miss in its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, falling short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nThe company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.25, which was $0.01 below the analyst estimate of $1.26. Revenue for the quarter was reported at $469.4 million, missing the consensus estimate of $482.01 million.\n\nDespite the earnings and revenue miss, SPX Corp (NYSE:SPXC). provided optimistic guidance for the fiscal year 2024, projecting an adjusted EPS range of $4.85 to $5.15, which is above the consensus estimate of $4.69. The company also expects revenue to reach between $1.93 billion and $2 billion, surpassing the consensus forecast of $1.889 billion.\n\nThe stock experienced a modest decline of 1.24% following the earnings release, indicating a somewhat negative investor reaction to the quarterly performance. The earnings miss and revenue shortfall drove the stock movement, reflecting concerns over the company's ability to meet market expectations.\n\nPresident and CEO Gene Lowe commented on the results, expressing satisfaction with the company's full-year performance, including significant growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Lowe highlighted the strong fourth-quarter performance of the HVAC segment, attributing it to record margin and profitability driven by robust customer demand and solid operational execution.\n\nSPX Corp.'s fourth-quarter revenue marked a 9.3% increase from the same period last year, while full-year revenue saw a 19.2% rise from the previous year. The company also noted several strategic acquisitions in the HVAC segment, which have strengthened its market position.\n\nLooking ahead, SPX Corp. anticipates continued demand strength in key markets and solid execution trends, positioning the company for another year of strong revenue and earnings growth. The midpoint of the company's 2024 adjusted EPS guidance reflects approximately 16% growth, while the adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint indicates around 25% growth.\n\nInvestors will be closely monitoring SPX Corp.'s performance as it navigates the upcoming fiscal year, with the company's optimistic guidance setting expectations for continued growth and profitability.\n\nAs SPX Technologies, Inc.

You can do all the agriculture but you can't take it to the market, you may not be able to preserve it, you can't even export it. So, all those indices are clearly connected to the ability to create energy,\" he emphasized.\n\nHe disclosed that Nigeria has a huge energy deficit with about 70% of the population lacking access to clean cooking fuel and over 50% lacking access to electricity.\n\nHe listed some of the impediments to the achievement of energy security in Nigeria to include lack of investment in the energy sector due to uncertainty in the business environment and multiple taxation, adding that in the last 10 years, less than 3% of the total investment flow into Africa came into Nigeria.\n\nHe, however, assured that NNPC Ltd was working hard to lay the foundation for sustainable wealth creation by filling the energy deficit gap, stressing that the company's growth trajectory from a loss position N803bn in 2018 to N2.5tr in 2022 was a testimony to the abundant potential of NNPC Ltd to lead the process of wealth creation in the country.\n\nA statement by Chief Corporate Communications Officer of NNPC Ltd, Olufemi Soneye said Kyari\n\nemphasized that in spite of the challenges, NNPC Ltd is still the highest tax paying corporate entity in Nigeria.",

    "title": "ANALYSIS/ As Tokyo stocks rally, many Japanese find themselves left behind | The Asahi Shimbun Asia & Japan Watch",
    "body": "For Takashi Karube and many Japanese like him, the Tokyo stock rally has been little to cheer about.\n\nThe Nikkei stock index hit its highest ever on Thursday, surpassing a record set in December 1989 and marking a once-unthinkable recovery for a market that spent much of the last three decades mired in malaise.\n\nRather than the flashy spending and bottomless optimism of the bubble years, the 34-year-old Karube, born just two months after the stock market's 1989 peak, grew up with frugality and constant reminders of Japan's declining economic might.\n\n\"My salary hasn't gone up in 10 years,\" said Karube, who works for an online bank. \"People think things are good as long as they can just keep their current standard of living.\"\n\nJapan slipped into recession at the end of last year, data showed this month, and is no longer the world's No. 3 economy, having lost that spot to Germany.\n\nKarube has tried to weather the higher food costs of recent years by shopping at discount supermarkets, bringing his lunch to work and eating out less.\n\nHe has been putting money into U.S. and global stock funds for the last seven or eight years, reflecting his pessimistic outlook about Japan.\n\nIn many ways, Japan has never escaped the trauma that followed the bubble's crash, when companies went bankrupt, banks imploded and executives even committed suicide.\n\nThe recent stock market run - driven by foreign investors as governance reform and a weak yen have made Japanese companies more attractive - has so far failed to dislodge Japan's long pessimism.\n\n\"If stocks go up, that doesn't really affect our living standards, and in a lot of ways Japan isn't doing well, the yen's very weak,\" said 57-year-old Sachio Kuroshima, as she waited for the shinkansen bullet train in Tokyo station.\n\nShe said she was considering putting some money into the government's NISA tax-free stock investment program but hadn't started yet.\n\nHARSH EXPERIENCE\n\nJapan's mom and pop investors have long been wary of their home market due to the \"harsh experience or memory from the Nikkei crash more than 30 years ago,\" said Tohru Sasaki, chief strategist at Fukuoka Financial Group, who previously worked at JPMorgan and the Bank of Japan.\n\nThat also helps explain why the millions of Japanese who have NISA stock accounts are largely investing overseas - most analyst estimates show the money has gone primarily into U.S. funds and stocks.\n\n\"The Japanese economy is not good at all. The reason why stocks are going up is because foreigners are buying,\" said 68-year-old Hiroyuki Saito, who ran an event production company before he retired.\n\nJapan was once a country with cutting-edge research in areas such as semiconductors, but no longer, he said.\n\nThe biggest companies are set to offer record wage increases again this year, responding to a push by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a \"virtuous cycle\" of higher wages feeding \"good\" inflation.\n\nBut the smaller companies that employ about 70 percent of the workforce have often struggled to raise wages.\n\n'BAD INFLATION'\n\nThe outlook for workers in general is not good, said 60-year-old Hajime Sato, who works at a construction firm that employs about 150 staff.\n\n\"Nothing is really trickling down,\" he said.\n\nA weak yen has pushed up the price of food, fuel and other goods - stoking the \"bad\" inflation the central bank, and Kishida, want to avoid.\n\nA weaker currency was once unequivocally seen as a positive for Japan's export-driven economy. Although it still fattens profits for the likes of Toyota Motor, it is less of a benefit than before, as many companies now manufacture overseas.\n\nFor 24-year-old Yui Iwatsuki, the excess of the bubble era - and all the designer clothes and handbags - would be unthinkable now.\n\nShe used to shop at department stores but now buys cheaper clothes because wages have barely risen at the building management company where she works.\n\n\"The way my parents' generation partied was very flashy,\" she said.\n\nYet the market rally has been something of a wake-up call for some Japanese.\n\n\"I was never really interested in investing in stocks before, but the recent stock market news and NISA have changed my mind,\" said Koji Yamaguchi, a salaryman in his 30s.\n\n\"I now feel the need to be more proactive in investing, especially as everything is getting more expensive and my pay rises aren't keeping pace.\"",

    "title": "D%: How USC, behind assistant Beth Burns, has created its own defensive metric",
    "body": "LOS ANGELES - Rayah Marshall grinned as if she were the keeper of a kingdom's tactics, backpedaling quickly away from a question about customs that have buoyed the USC women's basketball team's recent defensive surge.\n\n\"The defensive goal chart,\" Marshall said, walking away after Thursday's practice, flinging morsels of information over her shoulder with a smirk in her voice. \"If you know, you know. That's all I could say about that.\"\n\nThis is USC's best-kept secret. Except it's hardly a secret if you spend a minute with Beth Burns, USC's defensive guru and Lindsay Gottlieb's right-hand woman, who has implemented and popularized her own system of subjective defensive analytics - this \"goal chart\" - that the entire program has bought into.\n\nBack during her second stint from 2005-2013 as the head coach of San Diego State, Burns and the Aztecs took a trip up to play Saint Mary's. Burns knew longtime Saint Mary's men's coach Randy Bennett from his early coaching days at the University of San Diego; as such, Bennett offered to let Burns and her staff shower in the men's locker room before they returned home. And in the locker room, Bennett's whiteboard caught Burns' eye: scrawled with figures and words like defensive percentage.\n\nBurns, for long years, had mulled the lack of empirical data available to measure defense. From basketball's beginning of time, she explained with youthful enthusiasm Thursday, it was easy for players to empirically digest offensive performance: shoot 1-for-14, you played bad. Defense, she continued, was \"more just, your coach saying, 'You stink.'\"\n\nSo when San Diego State returned home, Burns called Bennett, and asked him about the system on his whiteboard. It provided the seeds for a defensive metric system that Burns has morphed and developed across the recent years of her coaching career, first bringing it to Louisville, then back to USC.\n\nEvery Tuesday, Burns breaks down video clips of every single possession in which an opposing team scored to USC players, assigning them a certain number of points and an efficiency score derived from a simple formula. It has worked wonders for a USC program that now sits at 20-4 and seventh in the AP Top 25, shooting up to second-place tie in the Pac-12 after a six-game conference win streak. Freshman JuJu Watkins' offensive explosions have been deservedly well-documented; USC, though, has hit its stride in large part because of swarming defensive effort, Watkins shooting a near-unholy 6-for-32 at Oregon State last Sunday and the Trojans still fighting to a win by holding the Beavers to 33% shooting.\n\n\"This is the secret sauce of it,\" Burns smiled Thursday, getting ready to explain her system.\n\nHere are the specifics. On plays where an opponent scores, Burns assigns those points to the USC defender or defenders directly responsible under the Trojans' defensive scheme. Say a perimeter defender was supposed to force someone baseline, and they went middle for a layup - Burns assigns that defender two points. Say a big doesn't box out and it turns into a three - Burns assigns that big three points.\n\nIndividual points, then, are compiled into a simple equation: points divided by minutes played, for a stat Burns calls simply \"D%.\" Anyone with a score of 29% or lower (which, if prorated to an entire team's output, would lead to 60 points or less being surrendered), Burns defines as being in the \"green\" zone. Anyone 39% or lower, in the yellow zone. Anyone above 39%, in the red zone.\n\n\"And you do not want to be red,\" Burns grinned.\n\nAcross the last three games, half of USC's roster has been in the green. Players have become accustomed, Burns said, to coming into film sessions, watching their mistakes, and bickering with her over their scores. The program, Gottlieb said Thursday, has improved in their understanding of defensive coverages, a trend that shows both in simple stats - USC hasn't surrendered more than 70 points since mid-January - and in Burns' metrics. As Burns sat in a baseline seat after Thursday's practice, she stopped an exiting Kayla Padilla for a moment, gushing in awe over the senior's game Feb. 12 against Arizona in which Padilla wasn't tabbed for any points on Burns' system.\n\n\"I've been doing this chart a long time, buddy, and I don't know anyone's done a 0 in 30 minutes,\" Burns said, Padilla placing her hand over her heart with a smile.\n\n\"Thanks, Coach B,\" Padilla responded.\n\nThe metric has spilled outside of practice courts and film rooms, Burns discussing Padilla's score excitedly with senior McKenzie Forbes in a Galen hallway long after practice wrapped up Thursday, the foundation of a program approach that has seen widespread individual defensive improvement. There's Watkins, who racks up deflections nearly as frequently as she does points. There's Marshall, who Gottlieb praised as \"quarterbacking\" USC's defense from the paint. There's Padilla, who's taken personal pride in her ascension from a score-first guard at Penn to a point-of-attack defender at USC.\n\n\"When you're playing, sometimes, it's like, 'Ope -- well, that's another two points on the D-chart,'\" Padilla said.",

An automated voice message on its customer information hotline said that the company \"made the difficult decision\" to suspend operations. It also directed callers to a special website to begin the refund process.\n\nA message on another website revealed that the cruse line had become financially unsustainable following the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nDespite our best efforts, demand for overnight cruises has not recovered following the pandemic, and AQV has become financially unsustainable. We thank you for your support and deeply regret any inconvenience this causes you. - per AQV Info's website\n\nPer the company's website, two American Queen cruse-ships were scheduled for 10 stops in Dubuque this summer. One ship with a maximum of 417 guests was set to dock in Dubuque six times, while the other ship, fit for a maximum 245 guests, was slated for four stops. The cruise line made 12 stops in Dubuque in 2023.\n\nPer the Telegraph Herald, the absence of the American Queen Voyages in Dubuque will certainly affect the tourism boost the community seeks from the ocean liners in the summertime.\n\nKeith Rahe, President/CEO of Travel Dubuque, told the Telegraph Herald that the cruises bring significant business to area hotels, restaurants, and several attractions to Dubuque and the surrounding areas, notably the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium.\n\nThere is the hope and belief that customers who saw their American Queen cruises cancelled will rebook with other cruise lines that make stops in the Dubuque-area.\n\nNo cruises were sailing at the time of the closure. Adam Peakes, Preside of Hornblower Group, who owns American Queen Voyages, said the company plans to sell, and if a sale cannot be achieved, \"its operations will be wound down,\" per USA Today:",

    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

He did not participate in any business of Muungwe Investments Private Limited or attend any meetings of the company, be it AGM or EGM,\" the former Zanu PF secretary for administration.\n\nMutasa insisted Mliswa has no entitlement to any shares, challenging him to produce a share certificate if he claims otherwise.\n\n\"I own 100% of its issued share capital. At some point in 2015, I agreed with fellow directors that I would give up to 30% of the shares to them in exchange for what they were supposed to contribute towards development of the land of the company.\n\n\"An agreement to that effect was signed, but it did not come into effect as the project had not started.\n\n\"The project only started when Muungwe Investments Private Limited lawfully engaged with Brobondo Private Limited in 2022, way after Mable Dete and Temba Mliswa were no longer part of the board directors,\" said Mutasa.\n\nMutasa was adamant Mliswa's claims would be baseless until he provided evidence of a share certificate and the transfer of shares.",

    "body": "(Reuters) -Shares in Jack Dorsey-led Block surged 12% on Thursday after the payments firm forecast adjusted core earnings for the current quarter above Wall Street estimates, betting on continued consumer resilience and its cost-cutting measures.\n\nThe company expects adjusted core earnings between $570 million and $590 million for the three months ended March 31, compared with analysts' average expectation of $511.76 million, according to LSEG data.\n\nBlock also raised its full-year profit guidance by more than $200 million, forecasting 2024 earnings of at least $2.63 billion, or at least 15% growth from the previous year.\n\nA robust holiday season has put consumer spending on a stronger path heading into 2024 as Americans put aside worries of an economic slowdown to keep shopping, dining out and traveling.\n\nMeanwhile, Block has been looking to lower costs and drive \"profitable growth\" in the business by cutting jobs and reducing its real estate footprint. The company has previously said it expects significant improvement in operating margins this year as these measures bear fruit.\n\nTotal net revenue rose 24% to $5.77 billion in the fourth quarter. Excluding bitcoin, revenue came in at $3.25 billion, up 15% compared to a year earlier.\n\n\"We've done a lot recently to reduce our costs. Now we're going to focus on growth,\" CEO Jack Dorsey wrote in a letter to shareholders, noting that Block is below its cap of 12,000 employees and intends to stay that way \"until we feel it's holding us back.\"\n\nNet loss in the quarter came in at $0.02 cents per share, in line with analyst expectations.\n\nEarlier this month, larger rival PayPal had forecast flat growth in adjusted profit for the current year as it seeks to turn leaner, drive profitable growth and ease pressure on its shares.\n\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in Washington; Editing by Chris Reese and Sonali Paul)",

    "title": "Home sales rose in January as easing mortgage rates, more homes for sale enticed homebuyers",
    "body": "By ALEX VEIGA - AP Business Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in January as homebuyers were encouraged by easing mortgage rates and a modest pickup in properties on the market.\n\nExisting home sales rose 3.1% last month from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That's the strongest sales pace since August and is slightly higher than the 3.98 million sales pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.\n\nThe modest sales increase is an encouraging start for the housing market, which has been mired in a slump the past two years. Still, compared with January 2023, sales fell 1.7%. Existing home sales sank to a nearly 30-year low last year, tumbling 18.7% from 2022.\n\n\"While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January's monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,\" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The national median sales price rose 5.1% from January last year to $379,100. That's the highest median sales price for January on records going back to 1999.\n\nFor the first time in 14 months, the median home sales price outpaced the 4.5% annual gain in U.S. wage growth recorded in January.\n\n\"It's unhealthy, we don't want to see it, but its a testament to the housing shortage we're facing in America,\" Yun said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCompetition for relatively few homes on the market and elevated mortgage rates have limited house hunters' buying power on top of years of soaring prices. That dynamic has helped keep home prices mostly rising despite weak home sales.\n\nThe cost of financing a home has largely come down from its most recent peak in late October, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hit a 23-year high of 7.79%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. But rates have been rising in recent weeks, with the average rate climbing this week to 6.90%, the highest level since mid-December.\n\n\"This is going to definitely impact the affordability for many people out there in the market place,\" Yun said. \"So, it's not good news.\"\n\nHomebuyers who could afford to sidestep mortgage rates altogether increasingly did so last month. Some 32% of the homes purchased last month were bought entirely with cash, the highest share in nearly 10 years, Yun noted.\n\nFirst-time homebuyers who don't have any home equity to put toward their down payment continued to have a tough time getting into the housing market. They accounted for just 28% of all homes sold last month. They've made up 40% of sales historically.\n\nA modest increase in the number of homes on the market helped lift sales. At the end of December, there were 1.01 million homes on the market, the NAR said. While that's a 3.1% increase from a year earlier, the number of available homes remains well below the monthly historical average of about 2.25 million.\n\nThe available inventory at the end of January amounted to a 3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. That's up 2% from the previous month and 3.1% January last year. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply.\n\nWhile more homes typically hit the market in the spring, many homeowners that have locked in a mortgage rate well below where rates are today may opt to stay put rather than give up their rock-bottom rates. Some two-thirds of U.S. homes have a mortgage with a rate under 4% and more than 90% have a rate below 6%.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

    "title": "Exclusive-US regulator drops some emissions disclosure requirements from draft climate rules",
    "body": "By Chris Prentice, Isla Binnie, Jarrett Renshaw and Douglas Gillison\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has removed some of its most ambitious greenhouse gas emission disclosure requirements from corporate climate risk rules it is preparing to adopt, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.\n\nThe SEC has dropped a requirement for U.S.-listed companies to disclose so-called Scope 3 emissions, which was included in its original draft of the rules published in March 2022, the sources said.\n\nScaling back these rules would be a blow for President Joe Biden's agenda to address climate change threats through federal agencies. Biden, a Democrat, has been under pressure from many lawmakers in his party to do more and move at a faster pace.\n\nScope 3 emissions account for greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, released in the atmosphere from a company's supply chain and the consumption of its products by customers. For most businesses, Scope 3 emissions represent more than 70% of their carbon footprint, according to consulting firm Deloitte.\n\nIf adopted, the new draft would represent a win for many corporations and their trade groups that lobbied to water down the rules. But it would also deviate from European Union rules which make Scope 3 disclosures mandatory for large companies starting this year and potentially complicate compliance for some global corporations.\n\nThe SEC's original draft proposed mandatory disclosure of emissions for which companies are more directly responsible, dubbed Scope 1 and Scope 2. Some lobbyists pushed the SEC to require such disclosures only if they are material to a company's business. Reuters could not ascertain whether the latest draft changed the Scope 1 and 2 requirement threshold.\n\nOnce the SEC settles on a final draft, it must be put to a vote among its five commissioners. The timing of the vote is not clear, and it is possible that the draft is revised before then.\n\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. An SEC spokesperson said the agency considered adjustments to its draft rules based on public feedback, but declined to comment on the contents of the latest draft of the climate risk rules.\n\n\"The Commission moves to adopt rules only when the staff and the Commission think they are ready to be considered,\" the SEC spokesperson said.\n\nThe SEC's March 2022 proposal would require publicly listed companies to disclose a range of climate-related risks that could affect their business. It argued that greenhouse gas emission disclosures are important for investors' due diligence. Companies have pushed back, arguing the data is hard to produce and legally contentious.\n\nReuters reported in November that the SEC told lobbyists and corporate executives it was considering watering down the rules.\n\nSome SEC officials worry that mandating disclosures across the board could make the rule more vulnerable to legal challenges which, if successful, could tie the agency's hands when writing other rules, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nThose concerns were fueled by a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2022 curbing the Environmental Protection Agency's power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. This raised doubts over whether SEC rules would survive a court challenge.\n\nSome corporate groups and Republican lawmakers also argued that tackling climate change-related issues exceeds the SEC's authority, and that the rules would be unduly burdensome for companies and cloud truly material information for investors.\n\nLITIGATION RISK\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler told an event held by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in October that he hoped the emissions disclosure rules, which received some 16,000 public comments, will survive any legal challenges once they are finalized and adopted.\n\n\"I would expect that whatever the rule says, unless they really water it down tremendously, there will be litigation,\" Columbia Law School Professor John Coffee, a securities regulations expert, said in an interview.\n\nLast year, California adopted a law that will require companies active in the state to disclose Scope 3 emissions as early as 2027. Corporate lobbyists said companies would still be reluctant to disclose Scope 3 emissions in SEC filings, even if they produced them for California, because including such information in securities filings gives grounds for more lawsuits from investors.\n\nSome voluntary initiatives such as the International Sustainability Standards Board already specify that it is best practice to disclose Scope 3 emissions.\n\n\"There is no question Scope 3 reporting is important, because otherwise you risk presenting a somewhat misleading picture of the company's greenhouse gas emissions,\" said Ben Schiffrin, director of securities policy at Washington, D.C-based consumer and investor advocacy group Better Markets.\n\n(Reporting by Chris Prentice and Isla Binnie in New York and Jarrett Renshaw and Douglas Gillison in Washington, D.C.; Additional reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Michelle Price, Greg Roumeliotis and Aurora Ellis)",

    "title": "UC-wide union rallies for the UC to \"break up\" with Blackstone on Valentine's Day, invest in affordable housing | The Daily Nexus",
    "body": "Union workers and students at seven UC campuses called for the UC to \"break up\" with Blackstone -- the largest commercial landlord in the U.S. -- and promote more affordable housing options in tandem with Valentine's Day at a Feb. 14 rally.\n\nThe joint action was organized by the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) Action, which previously helped pass the Homeless Prevention Act in 2019 to protect tenant rights. The collective effort was also supported by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) 3299, a UC-wide union representing over 30,000 service workers and patient care technical workers, among others. The union is currently undergoing contract negotiations with the University for better wages and benefits and wants to include a clause for divestment within their contract, according to AFSCME 3299 UC Santa Barbara chapter leader Wendy Santamaría.\n\n\"Right now they're bargaining for better wages, better benefits, but one of the specific things that we're negotiating is a housing package that is able to provide financial assistance for members,\" Santamaría said.\n\nIn January 2023, the UC invested $4.5 billion into Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT) -- totaling $6.5 billion in Blackstone holdings that the union is asking to be divested. The company has faced criticism over claims of raising rents, evicting tenants and failing to conduct basic maintenance on properties to allegedly maximize returns to shareholders. Last year, at UC San Diego, Blackstone acquired 6,000 units in a mobile park and increased rent prices by 40%, according to Cal Matters reporting.\n\nAt UCSB, the rally began at Storke Tower at 11 a.m. with around 10 students in attendance. Santamaría led the group in a march to Cheadle Hall, where Chancellor Henry T. Yang's office is located on the top floor.\n\nAs the group marched in a straight line down the Arbor walkway, they chanted \"UC, UC, you're no good. Treat your workers like you should,\" \"Blackstone, Blackstone, you better know. Tenants say you got to go,\" \"What do we want? Affordable rent. When do we want it? Now\" and \"Decent housing is right. We are here, ready to fight.\"\n\nUpon arriving at Cheadle Hall, several more campus workers and students joined the group. Some students carried signs that read \"Ceasefire in Gaza\" and \"End the occupation.\"\n\nSantamaría asked the group to share their personal stories in front of Cheadle Hall.\n\n\"This is my story. Today I just found out that I have no Valentine. So that means I now have no place to live. My thoughts are thinking of getting a van so I can live in that van, because I don't make enough at UCSB to afford housing,\" UCSB custodian and union member Felipe Gonzalez said. \"My problem with that is that the chancellor makes $500,000 [or] above a year and he's on welfare. We're paying for his home.\"\n\n\"We have value and we want to be recognized for that value,\" he continued.\n\nThe group went up the steps to the chancellor's office at 11:30 a.m. and knocked on the doors of the Chancellor's and Vice Chancellor's Offices. Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Margaret Klawunn addressed the group 10 minutes after entering the building.\n\nAFSCME 3299 intern Nelson Mu told Klawunn how difficult it is for students to secure housing.\n\n\"If you don't wanna live in university [housing], you gotta start looking for housing in September,\" third-year statistics and data science major and AFSCME 3299 intern Nelson Mu said to the vice-chancellor. \"You look at the university housing applications -- 50% of students don't get housing.\"\n\nHe referenced how in the first few hours of the university housing application opening, the portal crashed as 3,000 to 4,000 students tried to apply.\n\n\"We don't just have no affordable housing. We have, in some cases, no fucking housing,\" Mu said.\n\n\"This is a very time-sensitive issue. We have people literally living in cars, students living out of the RecCen. This is a dire situation. Can we expect an answer from the chancellor soon?\" Santamaría said.\n\nKlawunn said Yang was not in the building that day and said she would \"make sure the chancellor understood how dire it is.\" She also pointed out how the residence halls currently have vacancies for students.\n\n\"The workers are not going to be living in residence halls,\" Santamaría said in response. \"Our demands are not just go build more affordable housing. Specifically, we are asking the university to divest from Blackstone. $7 billion in there already that could be used for this affordable housing that we so desperately need.\"\n\nKlawunn said she would report the group's call for action to the chancellor. The rally ended after an hour and a half.\n\n\"This is something that is very interconnected. The more the university admits students without building housing for them, the more students and workers are competing for the very limited housing here and so as a result, you're seeing rents go up, folks getting evicted for little to no reason and honestly a lot of these are illegal evictions for the sole purpose of raising rent,\" Santamaría said.\n\nThis article was edited on Feb. 22 at 1:41 p.m. to clarify the rally was organized by ACCE and supported by AFSCME 3299, as it formerly stated it was organized by AFSCME 3299 and supported by ACCE.",

    "body": "LOS ANGELES - Rayah Marshall grinned as if she were the keeper of a kingdom's tactics, backpedaling quickly away from a question about customs that have buoyed the USC women's basketball team's recent defensive surge.\n\n\"The defensive goal chart,\" Marshall said, walking away after Thursday's practice, flinging morsels of information over her shoulder with a smirk in her voice. \"If you know, you know. That's all I could say about that.\"\n\nThis is USC's best-kept secret. Except it's hardly a secret if you spend a minute with Beth Burns, USC's defensive guru and Lindsay Gottlieb's right-hand woman, who has implemented and popularized her own system of subjective defensive analytics - this \"goal chart\" - that the entire program has bought into.\n\nBack during her second stint from 2005-2013 as the head coach of San Diego State, Burns and the Aztecs took a trip up to play Saint Mary's. Burns knew longtime Saint Mary's men's coach Randy Bennett from his early coaching days at the University of San Diego; as such, Bennett offered to let Burns and her staff shower in the men's locker room before they returned home. And in the locker room, Bennett's whiteboard caught Burns' eye: scrawled with figures and words like defensive percentage.\n\nBurns, for long years, had mulled the lack of empirical data available to measure defense. From basketball's beginning of time, she explained with youthful enthusiasm Thursday, it was easy for players to empirically digest offensive performance: shoot 1-for-14, you played bad. Defense, she continued, was \"more just, your coach saying, 'You stink.'\"\n\nSo when San Diego State returned home, Burns called Bennett, and asked him about the system on his whiteboard. It provided the seeds for a defensive metric system that Burns has morphed and developed across the recent years of her coaching career, first bringing it to Louisville, then back to USC.\n\nEvery Tuesday, Burns breaks down video clips of every single possession in which an opposing team scored to USC players, assigning them a certain number of points and an efficiency score derived from a simple formula. It has worked wonders for a USC program that now sits at 20-4 and seventh in the AP Top 25, shooting up to second-place tie in the Pac-12 after a six-game conference win streak. Freshman JuJu Watkins' offensive explosions have been deservedly well-documented; USC, though, has hit its stride in large part because of swarming defensive effort, Watkins shooting a near-unholy 6-for-32 at Oregon State last Sunday and the Trojans still fighting to a win by holding the Beavers to 33% shooting.\n\n\"This is the secret sauce of it,\" Burns smiled Thursday, getting ready to explain her system.\n\nHere are the specifics. On plays where an opponent scores, Burns assigns those points to the USC defender or defenders directly responsible under the Trojans' defensive scheme. Say a perimeter defender was supposed to force someone baseline, and they went middle for a layup - Burns assigns that defender two points. Say a big doesn't box out and it turns into a three - Burns assigns that big three points.\n\nIndividual points, then, are compiled into a simple equation: points divided by minutes played, for a stat Burns calls simply \"D%.\" Anyone with a score of 29% or lower (which, if prorated to an entire team's output, would lead to 60 points or less being surrendered), Burns defines as being in the \"green\" zone. Anyone 39% or lower, in the yellow zone. Anyone above 39%, in the red zone.\n\n\"And you do not want to be red,\" Burns grinned.\n\nAcross the last three games, half of USC's roster has been in the green. Players have become accustomed, Burns said, to coming into film sessions, watching their mistakes, and bickering with her over their scores. The program, Gottlieb said Thursday, has improved in their understanding of defensive coverages, a trend that shows both in simple stats - USC hasn't surrendered more than 70 points since mid-January - and in Burns' metrics. As Burns sat in a baseline seat after Thursday's practice, she stopped an exiting Kayla Padilla for a moment, gushing in awe over the senior's game Feb. 12 against Arizona in which Padilla wasn't tabbed for any points on Burns' system.\n\n\"I've been doing this chart a long time, buddy, and I don't know anyone's done a 0 in 30 minutes,\" Burns said, Padilla placing her hand over her heart with a smile.\n\n\"Thanks, Coach B,\" Padilla responded.\n\nThe metric has spilled outside of practice courts and film rooms, Burns discussing Padilla's score excitedly with senior McKenzie Forbes in a Galen hallway long after practice wrapped up Thursday, the foundation of a program approach that has seen widespread individual defensive improvement. There's Watkins, who racks up deflections nearly as frequently as she does points. There's Marshall, who Gottlieb praised as \"quarterbacking\" USC's defense from the paint. There's Padilla, who's taken personal pride in her ascension from a score-first guard at Penn to a point-of-attack defender at USC.\n\n\"When you're playing, sometimes, it's like, 'Ope -- well, that's another two points on the D-chart,'\" Padilla said.",

    "title": "Online fundraisers for violent West Bank settlers raised thousands, despite international sanctions",
    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

Defense, she continued, was \"more just, your coach saying, 'You stink.'\"\n\nSo when San Diego State returned home, Burns called Bennett, and asked him about the system on his whiteboard. It provided the seeds for a defensive metric system that Burns has morphed and developed across the recent years of her coaching career, first bringing it to Louisville, then back to USC.\n\nEvery Tuesday, Burns breaks down video clips of every single possession in which an opposing team scored to USC players, assigning them a certain number of points and an efficiency score derived from a simple formula. It has worked wonders for a USC program that now sits at 20-4 and seventh in the AP Top 25, shooting up to second-place tie in the Pac-12 after a six-game conference win streak. Freshman JuJu Watkins' offensive explosions have been deservedly well-documented; USC, though, has hit its stride in large part because of swarming defensive effort, Watkins shooting a near-unholy 6-for-32 at Oregon State last Sunday and the Trojans still fighting to a win by holding the Beavers to 33% shooting.\n\n\"This is the secret sauce of it,\" Burns smiled Thursday, getting ready to explain her system.\n\nHere are the specifics. On plays where an opponent scores, Burns assigns those points to the USC defender or defenders directly responsible under the Trojans' defensive scheme. Say a perimeter defender was supposed to force someone baseline, and they went middle for a layup - Burns assigns that defender two points. Say a big doesn't box out and it turns into a three - Burns assigns that big three points.\n\nIndividual points, then, are compiled into a simple equation: points divided by minutes played, for a stat Burns calls simply \"D%.\" Anyone with a score of 29% or lower (which, if prorated to an entire team's output, would lead to 60 points or less being surrendered), Burns defines as being in the \"green\" zone. Anyone 39% or lower, in the yellow zone. Anyone above 39%, in the red zone.\n\n\"And you do not want to be red,\" Burns grinned.\n\nAcross the last three games, half of USC's roster has been in the green. Players have become accustomed, Burns said, to coming into film sessions, watching their mistakes, and bickering with her over their scores. The program, Gottlieb said Thursday, has improved in their understanding of defensive coverages, a trend that shows both in simple stats - USC hasn't surrendered more than 70 points since mid-January - and in Burns' metrics. As Burns sat in a baseline seat after Thursday's practice, she stopped an exiting Kayla Padilla for a moment, gushing in awe over the senior's game Feb. 12 against Arizona in which Padilla wasn't tabbed for any points on Burns' system.\n\n\"I've been doing this chart a long time, buddy, and I don't know anyone's done a 0 in 30 minutes,\" Burns said, Padilla placing her hand over her heart with a smile.\n\n\"Thanks, Coach B,\" Padilla responded.\n\nThe metric has spilled outside of practice courts and film rooms, Burns discussing Padilla's score excitedly with senior McKenzie Forbes in a Galen hallway long after practice wrapped up Thursday, the foundation of a program approach that has seen widespread individual defensive improvement. There's Watkins, who racks up deflections nearly as frequently as she does points. There's Marshall, who Gottlieb praised as \"quarterbacking\" USC's defense from the paint. There's Padilla, who's taken personal pride in her ascension from a score-first guard at Penn to a point-of-attack defender at USC.\n\n\"When you're playing, sometimes, it's like, 'Ope -- well, that's another two points on the D-chart,'\" Padilla said.",

    "body": "LOS ANGELES - Rayah Marshall grinned as if she were the keeper of a kingdom's tactics, backpedaling quickly away from a question about customs that have buoyed the USC women's basketball team's recent defensive surge.\n\n\"The defensive goal chart,\" Marshall said, walking away after Thursday's practice, flinging morsels of information over her shoulder with a smirk in her voice. \"If you know, you know. That's all I could say about that.\"\n\nThis is USC's best-kept secret. Except it's hardly a secret if you spend a minute with Beth Burns, USC's defensive guru and Lindsay Gottlieb's right-hand woman, who has implemented and popularized her own system of subjective defensive analytics - this \"goal chart\" - that the entire program has bought into.\n\nBack during her second stint from 2005-2013 as the head coach of San Diego State, Burns and the Aztecs took a trip up to play Saint Mary's. Burns knew longtime Saint Mary's men's coach Randy Bennett from his early coaching days at the University of San Diego; as such, Bennett offered to let Burns and her staff shower in the men's locker room before they returned home. And in the locker room, Bennett's whiteboard caught Burns' eye: scrawled with figures and words like defensive percentage.\n\nBurns, for long years, had mulled the lack of empirical data available to measure defense.

    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

They have very elevated earnings expectations and very elevated valuations that doesn't give any room for disappointment,\" Phillip Colmar of MRB Partners told CNBC Thursday. He added the Nvidia-fueled market rally still carries \"inherent risk\" to it, given the cyclical nature of semiconductor stocks.\n\nIn a day marked by bullish momentum, Thursday's closing bell on Wall Street saw significant gains across major indexes.

Two Navy SEALS died during the mission.\n\nU.S. officials said that Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J. Chambers was boarding the boat on Jan. 11 and slipped into the gap created by high waves between the vessel and the SEALs' combatant craft. As Chambers fell, Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram jumped in to try to save him, according to U.S. officials familiar with what happened.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that the four defendants were transporting suspected Iranian-made missile components for the type of weapons used by Houthi rebel forces in recent attacks.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

    "body": "By\n\nBloomberg Published\n\nFeb 22, 2024 Reading time\n\n2 minutes Download\n\nPrint\n\nText size\n\naA+ aA- American Apparel owner boosts dividend as shareholder vote lies ahead By\n\nBloomberg Published\n\nFeb 22, 2024\n\nClothing maker Gildan Activewear Inc., embroiled in a fight with shareholders over the firing of its longtime CEO, increased its dividend 10% and reported earnings that beat analysts' forecasts.\n\nThe Montreal-based company, which owns the American Apparel brand, reported earnings of 75 cents per share on an adjusted basis for the fourth quarter, beating the average estimate by 2 cents. The shares rose as much as 8.1% in Toronto.\n\nFor the full year in 2023, Gildan's earnings per share fell 17%, partly because it saw a drop in activewear sales, its most important segment.\n\nAds\n\nGildan's board is involved in a nasty dispute with several institutional shareholders and former Chief Executive Officer Glenn Chamandy, who was sacked in December over disagreements about the company's succession plan and strategy. Some of its largest investors, led by Browning West LP, are trying to vote out the board and reinstate Chamandy. The matter may be decided at a shareholder meeting scheduled for May 28.\n\nThe company warned analysts at the start of Wednesday's conference call that executives would only answer questions about the financial results.\n\nLast year was \"a year of strong progress on Gildan's sustainable growth strategy despite an overall challenging macroeconomic backdrop,\" Vince Tyra, the new CEO, said on the call. \"This foundation, together with a solid balance sheet, puts us in an enviable position.\"\n\nGildan is projecting revenue growth will be \"flat to up low-single digits\" in 2024 as the industry is impacted by soft demand, Chief Financial Officer Rhodri Harries told analysts. Its corporate tax rate might jump because of regulatory changes, the company said, but earnings per share should increase more than 13% and free cash flow should rise over last year's levels.\n\n\"Gildan is at an inflection point with its earnings profile, and should see attractive upside to the share price should the CEO succession resolution come to fruition in a manner in the best interest of all stakeholders,\" TD Cowen analyst Brian Morrison said in a note to investors.\n\nRead more on the Gildan governance battle\n\nThe dismissal of Chamandy in December led to $6.3 million in expenses, including termination costs and advisory and legal fees for \"shareholder matters.\"\n\nWhen asked about long-term growth opportunities, Tyra said a strategy would come this year, and would be focused on \"tweaks and enhancement\" -- such as leveraging the American Apparel brand -- and organic growth.\n\nGildan was up nearly 4% to C$47.59 as of 10:48 a.m. in Toronto, the highest since Dec. 8 -- the last trading day before Chamandy was ousted.\n\nCopyright Bloomberg\n\nTags : Fashion Ready-to-wear Business",

    "title": "Online fundraisers for violent West Bank settlers raised thousands, despite international sanctions",
    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

    "title": "Matt Calkins: Should Jordyn Brooks, a staple but not a standout, return to Seahawks?",
    "body": "Ask an everyday Seattle sports fan to name five Seahawks, and Jordyn Brooks probably won't come up.\n\nHis jersey never pervaded Lumen Field. The chances -- percentage-wise -- of him ever making the ring of honor probably start with a decimal point.\n\nBut the linebacker is a former first-rounder who has spent four seasons in Seattle, three and half of them as a starter. He could also be gone by March.\n\nShould he be?\n\nBrooks started his career with the unenviable task of lining up with future Hall of Famer Bobby Wagner and former Pro Bowler K.J. Wright. It was the twilight stage of the Seahawks' golden linebacker age, and the powers that be -- then-Seahawks coach Pete Carroll and current general manager John Schneider -- took him 27th in the 2020 NFL draft hoping he'd be the LB of the future.\n\nWhat ensued was a solid but not quite stellar four seasons on a defense that has been among the NFL's worst since he arrived. So as he wades in free agency, it's worth asking if he's worth bringing back.\n\nAs it stands, Brooks is ranked as the 50th most desirable free agent by analytics site Pro Football Focus. In other words, he'd be most teams' second-best free agent and the third or fourth on a few others. This unlikely is what the Seahawks or Brooks envisioned when he was drafted -- and certainly not what either hoped for -- but he has done little to prove himself as an elite linebacker.\n\nIt wasn't until last season that Brooks nabbed the first (and only) interception of his career. He has forced two fumbles (one in 2022, and one last season) and has tallied 6.5 career sacks -- 4.5 of them coming in 2023. In 2021 he led the league in solo tackles with 109. But that was the season Seattle finished last in time of possession (nearly a minute and a half less than the next-to-last team) meaning Brooks was just perpetually on the field.\n\nOf course, the fact that Carroll wouldn't take him off the field spoke to a relative level of productivity. Brooks was never the flashiest player -- and his impact never reached the heights of Wagner or Wright. But his starting spot wasn't in question.\n\nStill, when you're ranked 69th out of 82 linebackers by PFF, as Brooks was last season, you come off as expendable. His ranking was even worse the season before, when he replaced Wagner at middle linebacker.\n\nBrooks' next contract has been projected between $9 million and $10 million. The Seahawks are about $5 million over the salary cap. Adding to the Brooks equation is that the Seahawks A) might want to re-sign defensive end Leonard Williams (a more coveted player on the free-agent market) and B) might want to reunite former Ravens linebacker-turned-free-agent Patrick Queen with coach Mike Macdonald, the ex-Baltimore defensive coordinator.\n\nBrooks has been transparent about the fact that his days in Seattle might be over. That Carroll, the coach who drafted him, is no longer with the team may amplify those chances. He also has held himself accountable for the Seahawks' defensive shortcomings, saying in December that they have greatly underachieved on that side of the ball and that he's part of it.\n\nAnd though he was never touted as a defensive savior the way, say, Devon Witherspoon was last draft or Jamal Adams was when Seattle traded for him, it's fair to ask whether these past four years have been a disappointment for the 26-year-old.\n\nTo Brooks' credit, he shocked a lot of people by starting in Week 1 last season, less than eight months after tearing an ACL. He has been durable, missing just five games in four seasons -- no easy feat for a linebacker. Still, while he's been a staple in the lineup, he hasn't been a standout.\n\nI'm not sure much of Seattle is waiting on the edge of its seat wondering if Brooks is going to return to the Seahawks next season. The 12s, I'm sure, are thinking more about any whales the team might land from other teams and who the brass will take during the draft.\n\nBut Jordyn plays a key position and could potentially play a key role for this team next season.\n\nThis is Schneider's team now, and he has a new coach in his ear. I am not going to predict whether Brooks comes back, but he hasn't proven himself as a necessity.\n\n(c)2024 The Seattle Times\n\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

    "title": "Home sales rose in January as easing mortgage rates, more homes for sale enticed homebuyers",
    "body": "By ALEX VEIGA - AP Business Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in January as homebuyers were encouraged by easing mortgage rates and a modest pickup in properties on the market.\n\nExisting home sales rose 3.1% last month from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That's the strongest sales pace since August and is slightly higher than the 3.98 million sales pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.\n\nThe modest sales increase is an encouraging start for the housing market, which has been mired in a slump the past two years. Still, compared with January 2023, sales fell 1.7%. Existing home sales sank to a nearly 30-year low last year, tumbling 18.7% from 2022.\n\n\"While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January's monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,\" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The national median sales price rose 5.1% from January last year to $379,100. That's the highest median sales price for January on records going back to 1999.\n\nFor the first time in 14 months, the median home sales price outpaced the 4.5% annual gain in U.S. wage growth recorded in January.\n\n\"It's unhealthy, we don't want to see it, but its a testament to the housing shortage we're facing in America,\" Yun said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCompetition for relatively few homes on the market and elevated mortgage rates have limited house hunters' buying power on top of years of soaring prices. That dynamic has helped keep home prices mostly rising despite weak home sales.\n\nThe cost of financing a home has largely come down from its most recent peak in late October, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hit a 23-year high of 7.79%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. But rates have been rising in recent weeks, with the average rate climbing this week to 6.90%, the highest level since mid-December.\n\n\"This is going to definitely impact the affordability for many people out there in the market place,\" Yun said. \"So, it's not good news.\"\n\nHomebuyers who could afford to sidestep mortgage rates altogether increasingly did so last month. Some 32% of the homes purchased last month were bought entirely with cash, the highest share in nearly 10 years, Yun noted.\n\nFirst-time homebuyers who don't have any home equity to put toward their down payment continued to have a tough time getting into the housing market. They accounted for just 28% of all homes sold last month. They've made up 40% of sales historically.\n\nA modest increase in the number of homes on the market helped lift sales. At the end of December, there were 1.01 million homes on the market, the NAR said. While that's a 3.1% increase from a year earlier, the number of available homes remains well below the monthly historical average of about 2.25 million.\n\nThe available inventory at the end of January amounted to a 3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. That's up 2% from the previous month and 3.1% January last year. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply.\n\nWhile more homes typically hit the market in the spring, many homeowners that have locked in a mortgage rate well below where rates are today may opt to stay put rather than give up their rock-bottom rates. Some two-thirds of U.S. homes have a mortgage with a rate under 4% and more than 90% have a rate below 6%.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

    "body": "The real estate market has been something of a roller coaster ride over the past few years. Historically low interest rates coupled with a surging interest to move to communities with more outdoor space during the height of the pandemic led to a lot of movement and inventory -- as well as some of the highest home prices in some time.\n\nThe tides have started to change in recent months, as the housing market has been tepid at best since interest rates have increased. In the week ending August 24, 2023, the national average 30-year fixed mortgage rate pushed to 7.23 percent, while the National Association of Realtors said the median existing-home sales price was expected to surpass the all-time high of $413,800. The stagnation of the market is caused by high interest rates, sellers not wanting to budge on prices, individuals wanting to sell but not being able to afford other homes, and a general decline in inventory related to each of these factors.\n\nBy Carrie Dunlea\n\nFor more on this story see the February 22, 2024 print, or digital edition of The Sachse News.

    "body": "The global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market will continue growing into the 2040s, mostly driven by China's industrial decarburization and the increasing demand in other Asian countries, according to a recently released report.\n\nGlobal demand for LNG is estimated to rise by more than 50 percent by 2040, as industrial coal-to-gas switching gains pace in China, as well as in South and Southeast Asian countries, using more LNG to support their economic growth, according to Shell's LNG Outlook 2024.\n\n\"China is likely to dominate LNG demand growth this decade as its industry seeks to cut carbon emissions by switching from coal to gas,\" said Steve Hill, Executive vice-president for Shell Energy.\n\nAccording to the report, China's gas infrastructure development has accelerated while the country's long-term gas and LNG demand outlook remains strong.\n\nRelatively mild winter temperatures in countries that rely on gas for heating, combined with high gas storage levels, stronger nuclear power generation and a modest economic recovery in China, helped balance the global gas market in 2023, it said.\n\nSource: China Daily",

    "body": "LONDON (AP) -- Britain's government said Thursday it is withdrawing from a controversial international energy treaty after efforts to modernize it ended in stalemate.\n\nThe U.K.'s move followed similar announcements by France, Germany and other European Union countries to quit the Energy Charter Treaty, which critics say is being used by the fossil fuel industry to legally challenge governments over their climate policies.\n\nThe treaty entered into force in 1998 to protect and encourage international flows of investment in the energy sector. But a number of countries have faced costly legal challenges over reducing their reliance on fossil fuels and boosting greener energy sources.\n\nU.K. officials said negotiations to update the treaty to better support cleaner technologies had gone on for several years, but resulted in an impasse among European countries.\n\n\"The Energy Charter Treaty is outdated and in urgent need of reform but talks have stalled and sensible renewal looks increasingly unlikely,\" said Graham Stuart, a minister for energy security.\n\n\"Remaining a member would not support our transition to cleaner, cheaper energy, and could even penalise us for our world-leading efforts to deliver net zero.\"\n\nFrance and Italy announced in late 2022 that they were leaving the treaty. Other countries including Spain and the Netherlands also did the same. Britain's government said that in total it was joining nine EU member states in withdrawing.\n\nClimate nongovernmental organizations have called for a mass EU withdrawal from the treaty. Several dozen countries are still listed as signatories on the treaty's website.",

    "title": "Home sales rose in January as easing mortgage rates, more homes for sale enticed homebuyers",
    "body": "By ALEX VEIGA - AP Business Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in January as homebuyers were encouraged by easing mortgage rates and a modest pickup in properties on the market.\n\nExisting home sales rose 3.1% last month from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That's the strongest sales pace since August and is slightly higher than the 3.98 million sales pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.\n\nThe modest sales increase is an encouraging start for the housing market, which has been mired in a slump the past two years. Still, compared with January 2023, sales fell 1.7%. Existing home sales sank to a nearly 30-year low last year, tumbling 18.7% from 2022.\n\n\"While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January's monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,\" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The national median sales price rose 5.1% from January last year to $379,100. That's the highest median sales price for January on records going back to 1999.\n\nFor the first time in 14 months, the median home sales price outpaced the 4.5% annual gain in U.S. wage growth recorded in January.\n\n\"It's unhealthy, we don't want to see it, but its a testament to the housing shortage we're facing in America,\" Yun said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nCompetition for relatively few homes on the market and elevated mortgage rates have limited house hunters' buying power on top of years of soaring prices. That dynamic has helped keep home prices mostly rising despite weak home sales.\n\nThe cost of financing a home has largely come down from its most recent peak in late October, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hit a 23-year high of 7.79%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. But rates have been rising in recent weeks, with the average rate climbing this week to 6.90%, the highest level since mid-December.\n\n\"This is going to definitely impact the affordability for many people out there in the market place,\" Yun said. \"So, it's not good news.\"\n\nHomebuyers who could afford to sidestep mortgage rates altogether increasingly did so last month. Some 32% of the homes purchased last month were bought entirely with cash, the highest share in nearly 10 years, Yun noted.\n\nFirst-time homebuyers who don't have any home equity to put toward their down payment continued to have a tough time getting into the housing market. They accounted for just 28% of all homes sold last month. They've made up 40% of sales historically.\n\nA modest increase in the number of homes on the market helped lift sales. At the end of December, there were 1.01 million homes on the market, the NAR said. While that's a 3.1% increase from a year earlier, the number of available homes remains well below the monthly historical average of about 2.25 million.\n\nThe available inventory at the end of January amounted to a 3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. That's up 2% from the previous month and 3.1% January last year. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply.\n\nWhile more homes typically hit the market in the spring, many homeowners that have locked in a mortgage rate well below where rates are today may opt to stay put rather than give up their rock-bottom rates. Some two-thirds of U.S. homes have a mortgage with a rate under 4% and more than 90% have a rate below 6%.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

However, it is no longer cost-effective for us to distribute our digital content the way we have done previously. Moving forward, we will look to partner with established media companies to distribute our digital content, including news, on their global platforms, as we fully transition to a studio model. As part of this shift, we will no longer publish content on vice.com, instead putting more emphasis on our social channels as we accelerate our discussions with partners to take our content to where it will be viewed most broadly,\" Dixon wrote in the note to staff.\n\n\"With this strategic shift comes the need to realign our resources and streamline our overall operations at Vice. Regrettably, this means that we will be reducing our workforce, eliminating several hundred positions. This decision was not made lightly, and I understand the significant impact it will have on those affected. Employees who will be affected will be notified about next steps early next week, consistent with local laws and practices,\" he added.\n\nVice-owned Refinery 29 will continue as a standalone digital publishing business.",

    "title": "Live Nation reports 2023 biggest year ever for concert turnout and ticket sales",
    "body": "Live Nation, the entertainment giant that owns Ticketmaster, reported its biggest year ever in 2023, in terms of both attendance and ticket sales.\n\nIn its end-of-year report, the company, currently the subject of an antitrust investigation by the US justice department, said concert attendance was up by 20% compared to 2022, with more than 145 million fans attending more than 50,000 events. Ticketmaster sold 620m tickets, up 13% compared to the year prior.\n\nDuring the year, which saw headline-grabbing international tours from such mega-artists as Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, the company's total revenue increased 36% to $22.7bn, while operating income went up 46% to $1.07bn.\n\nThe increase in shows and attendance also translated into double-digit increases in ancillary sales for arenas, amphitheaters and other venue types, according to the company. The report also highlighted the global industry expansion in its blockbuster year, with 50% more international acts in the top 50 tours, and 15% more shows on average, compared to five years ago - before the Covid pandemic brought the live-events industry to a halt.\n\nThough the industry has more than rebounded since then, there are still major concerns for Live Nation's business, namely the ongoing antitrust investigation and outrage over Ticketmaster's mishandling of sales for Swift's Eras tour, which left many fans empty-handed, crashed the site and sent resale prices soaring. Several Swift fans sued Ticketmaster for \"fraud, price-fixing and antitrust violations\", alleging that \"intentional deception\" allowed scalpers to buy the majority of tickets; within hours of the first sale, tickets were being resold on secondary seller sites for as much as $22,000 (£18,000).\n\nRelated: US senators introduce 'fans first' live-event ticketing reform bill\n\nThe debacle led a bipartisan group of six US senators to introduce the Fans First Act in December. The proposed legislation would increase transparency in ticket sales, protect consumers from fake or overpriced tickets, and build accountability measures for bad actors. The bill would also strengthen the Better Online Ticket Sales (Bots) Act, signed into law in 2016, to further prohibit the use of bots to purchase tickets online; it would impose civil penalties on illegal resales and establish a website for fans to file complaints monitored by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nThis year seems poised to be equally robust in terms of ticket sales, with the second international and domestic legs of the Eras tour, as well as tours from internationally popular artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Drake, Bad Bunny and Olivia Rodrigo, among others.\n\n\"The live music industry reached new heights in 2023, and demand for live music continues to build,\" said Michael Rapino, the president and CEO of Live Nation, in a statement accompanying the report. \"Our digital world empowers artists to develop global followings, while inspiring fans to crave in-person experiences more than ever. At the same time, the industry is delivering a wider variety of concerts which draws in new audiences, and developing more venues to support a larger show pipeline.\"\n\nHe added: \"Against this backdrop, we expect all our businesses to continue growing and adding value to artists and fans as we deliver double-digit operating income and AOI growth again this year, with our profitability compounding by double-digits over the next several years.\"",

    "body": "The six-legged robot lander, dubbed Odysseus, was due to begin the final descent from lunar orbit with a blast of its main engine about an hour before landing, with touchdown anticipated at 6:24 p.m. EST (2324 GMT) on Thursday, according to the company's latest flight plan. The vehicle, targeting a crater named Malapert A near the moon's south pole, is carrying a suite of scientific instruments and technology demonstrations for NASA and several commercial customers designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the polar landing site.\n\nA spacecraft built and flown by Houston-based company Intuitive Machines sailed around the moon on Thursday to attempt the first U.S. touchdown on the lunar surface in more than half a century and the first ever entirely by the private sector. The six-legged robot lander, dubbed Odysseus, was due to begin the final descent from lunar orbit with a blast of its main engine about an hour before landing, with touchdown anticipated at 6:24 p.m. EST (2324 GMT) on Thursday, according to the company's latest flight plan.\n\nThe vehicle, targeting a crater named Malapert A near the moon's south pole, is carrying a suite of scientific instruments and technology demonstrations for NASA and several commercial customers designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the polar landing site. The NASA payload will focus on collecting data on space weather interactions with the moon's surface, radio astronomy and other aspects of the lunar environment for future landers and NASA's planned return of astronauts later in the decade.\n\nThe uncrewed spacecraft has been circling the moon about 57 miles (92 km) above the surface since reaching orbit on Wednesday, six days after it was launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Odysseus remained \"in excellent health\" as it continued to orbit the moon, roughly 239,000 miles (384,000 km) from Earth, transmitting flight data and lunar images to Intuitive Machines' mission control center in Houston, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nIf the landing succeeds, the IM-1 mission would represent the first controlled descent to the lunar surface by a U.S. spacecraft since Apollo 17 in 1972, when NASA's last crewed moon mission landed there with astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. To date, spacecraft from just four other countries have ever landed on the moon - the former Soviet Union, China, India and, mostly recently, just last month, Japan. The United States is the only one ever to have sent humans to the lunar surface.\n\nDAWN OF ARTEMIS Success of Odysseus also would be the first \"soft landing\" on the moon ever by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle and the first under NASA's Artemis lunar program, as the U.S. races to return astronauts to Earth's natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft there.\n\nNASA aims to land its first crewed Artemis in late 2026 as part of long-term, sustained lunar exploration and a stepping stone toward eventual human flights to Mars. The initiative focuses on the moon's south pole in part because a presumed bounty of frozen water exists there that can be used for life support and production of rocket fuel. A host of small landers like Odysseus are expected to pave the way under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, designed to deliver instruments and hardware to the moon at lower costs than the U.S. space agency's traditional method of building and launching those vehicles itself.\n\nLeaning more heavily on smaller, less experienced private ventures comes with its own risks. Just last month the lunar lander of another firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak on its way to the moon shortly after being placed in orbit on Jan. 8 by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket making its debut flight. The malfunction of Astrobotic's Peregrine lander marked the third failure of a private company to achieve a lunar touchdown, following ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan.\n\nAlthough Odysseus is the latest star of NASA's CLPS program, the IM-1 flight is considered an Intuitive Machines mission. The company was co-founded in 2013 by Stephen Altemus, former deputy director of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston and now the company's president and CEO. The proliferation of commercial space ventures has itself been driven by leaps in technology in recent decades.\n\nThe Apollo program and robot lunar Surveyor missions that preceded it flew at the very dawn of the computer age, before the advent of modern microchips, electronic sensors and software, or the development of super light-weight metal alloys and myriad other advances that have spurred a revolution in spaceflight.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

    "title": "Live Nation reports 2023 biggest year ever for concert turnout and ticket sales",
    "body": "Live Nation, the entertainment giant that owns Ticketmaster, reported its biggest year ever in 2023, in terms of both attendance and ticket sales.\n\nIn its end-of-year report, the company, currently the subject of an antitrust investigation by the US justice department, said concert attendance was up by 20% compared to 2022, with more than 145 million fans attending more than 50,000 events. Ticketmaster sold 620m tickets, up 13% compared to the year prior.\n\nDuring the year, which saw headline-grabbing international tours from such mega-artists as Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, the company's total revenue increased 36% to $22.7bn, while operating income went up 46% to $1.07bn.\n\nThe increase in shows and attendance also translated into double-digit increases in ancillary sales for arenas, amphitheaters and other venue types, according to the company. The report also highlighted the global industry expansion in its blockbuster year, with 50% more international acts in the top 50 tours, and 15% more shows on average, compared to five years ago - before the Covid pandemic brought the live-events industry to a halt.\n\nThough the industry has more than rebounded since then, there are still major concerns for Live Nation's business, namely the ongoing antitrust investigation and outrage over Ticketmaster's mishandling of sales for Swift's Eras tour, which left many fans empty-handed, crashed the site and sent resale prices soaring. Several Swift fans sued Ticketmaster for \"fraud, price-fixing and antitrust violations\", alleging that \"intentional deception\" allowed scalpers to buy the majority of tickets; within hours of the first sale, tickets were being resold on secondary seller sites for as much as $22,000 (£18,000).\n\nRelated: US senators introduce 'fans first' live-event ticketing reform bill\n\nThe debacle led a bipartisan group of six US senators to introduce the Fans First Act in December. The proposed legislation would increase transparency in ticket sales, protect consumers from fake or overpriced tickets, and build accountability measures for bad actors. The bill would also strengthen the Better Online Ticket Sales (Bots) Act, signed into law in 2016, to further prohibit the use of bots to purchase tickets online; it would impose civil penalties on illegal resales and establish a website for fans to file complaints monitored by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nThis year seems poised to be equally robust in terms of ticket sales, with the second international and domestic legs of the Eras tour, as well as tours from internationally popular artists such as Jennifer Lopez, Drake, Bad Bunny and Olivia Rodrigo, among others.\n\n\"The live music industry reached new heights in 2023, and demand for live music continues to build,\" said Michael Rapino, the president and CEO of Live Nation, in a statement accompanying the report. \"Our digital world empowers artists to develop global followings, while inspiring fans to crave in-person experiences more than ever. At the same time, the industry is delivering a wider variety of concerts which draws in new audiences, and developing more venues to support a larger show pipeline.\"\n\nHe added: \"Against this backdrop, we expect all our businesses to continue growing and adding value to artists and fans as we deliver double-digit operating income and AOI growth again this year, with our profitability compounding by double-digits over the next several years.\"",

    "title": "Online fundraisers for violent West Bank settlers raised thousands, despite international sanctions",
    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

    "title": "Nvidia's stock market value rose $273 billion in a day. How it rose to AI prominence, by the numbers",
    "body": "Nvidia's stock price jumped 16% on Thursday, increasing the company's market value by a staggering $273 billion in just one day, a record amount.\n\nThe chipmaker has been seeing soaring demand for its semiconductors, which are used to power artificial intelligence, or AI applications. The company's revenue more than tripled in the latest quarter compared with the same period a year earlier.\n\nIt's the latest sign that the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence likely won't subside anytime soon. Nvidia, which has positioned itself as one of the most prominent players in AI, has been producing some eye-popping numbers. Here's a look:\n\nThe amount Nvidia Corp.'s market value increased on Thursday alone, according to FactSet. The previous record one-day jump was Meta Platform's gain of $205 billion on Feb. 2 of this year. In other words, Nvidia's one-day gain is more than the total market values of market stalwarts Bank of America ($265 billion) and Coca-Cola ($263 billion). In all, just 26 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 have market caps above $273 billion, including Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's total market value as of the close of trading Thursday. It recently passed Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable public company, behind Microsoft ($3.051 trillion) and Apple ($2.845 trillion). The company was valued at around $580 billion a year ago.\n\nRevenue for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28, more than double Nvidia's revenue for 2022 and about 6 times what it was five years ago. Wall Street expects Nvidia's revenue to top $100 billion in fiscal 2025.\n\nThat's Nvidia's net margin, or the percentage of revenue that gets turned in profit. Looked at another way, almost 50 cents of every $1 in revenue Nvidia took in last year went to its bottom line. By comparison, Apple's net margin is 25.3% and Microsoft's is 34.1%. Both those companies have significantly higher revenue than Nvidia, however.",

    "body": "Metra, the primary commuter rail system in the Chicago metropolitan area, is set to get its first battery-powered trains in the coming years, which could replace diesel-powered locomotives in places and times of day with fewer riders.\n\nMetra touted the trains as a more economical and environmentally friendly option during off-peak times, and believes the trains will be among the first to use the technology in the U.S.\n\nThey consist of two attached railcars that can hold 112 passengers with a power unit between the cars that passengers can pass through. The trains can be controlled from either end and have their own propulsion system, so a separate locomotive isn't necessary.\n\nManufactured by Stadler U.S., a Salt Lake City, Utah-based division of the Swiss train-maker, they are expected to be delivered in 2027 or 2028.\n\nMetra board members approved buying eight of the two-car trains for $154 million Wednesday, with the option to spend up to $181.4 million more for eight additional trains and up to 32 cars that can be added onto the trains to expand them to three or four cars long. Each extra car can seat about 46 people.\n\nMetra plans to test the trains on the 16.4-mile branch of the Rock Island line that runs from LaSalle Street Station through the Beverly neighborhood to Blue Island.\n\n\"It's a highly residential neighborhood,\" Metra CEO Jim Derwinski said. \"They'll probably really enjoy the fact that they're quiet.\"\n\nAfter they are tested in multiple seasons, the trains could be expanded to include more cars or used elsewhere when ridership is relatively low, like for evening service, Derwinski said. Morning commuters on Metra's busiest lines are unlikely to ride on the battery-powered trains.\n\n\"This will never be a vehicle that moves 1,500 people,\" he said.\n\nThe purchase will be largely funded by a federal grant, though about $30 million in state funds will be used to meet a required local match for the initial purchase.\n\nThe new cars will have one level of seating, and passengers will be able to walk from car to car through open gangways. They are set to include bike racks, luggage racks and USB outlets.\n\nThe trains will have lifts to make them compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and half the cars will include ADA-accessible bathrooms.\n\nThe trains are expected to be able to travel 45 to 65 miles on a full charge, and it could take 20 to 30 minutes for a train to charge enough to operate.\n\nMetra said the type and cost of charging infrastructure has not yet been determined.\n\nStadler has built electric, diesel-electric hybrid and battery-powered trains for European customers, Metra said. In the U.S., it is already building trains similar to those ordered by Metra but they are powered by diesel or hydrogen fuel cells.\n\n©2024 Chicago Tribune.

    "body": "An ongoing cybersecurity breach that hit the health technology company Change Healthcare this week has led to prescription delays for at least a few small pharmacies in the U.S., with some interruptions reported by bigger institutions like Walgreens, according to the pharmacies.\n\nChange Healthcare -- a technology company based in Tennessee that is part of the health services provider Optum, Inc. and owned by the massive conglomerate UnitedHealth Group -- first reported experiencing company-wide connectivity problems on Wednesday morning. By Thursday, both the subsidiary and UnitedHealth acknowledged that a cybersecurity issue had caused a network outage that was expected to last 24 hours or more.\n\n\"Change Healthcare is experiencing a cyber security issue and our experts are working to address the matter,\" a spokesperson for UnitedHealth said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday. \"Once we became aware of the outside threat, in the interest of protecting our partners and patients, we took immediate action to disconnect our systems to prevent further impact.\"\n\n\"At this time, we believe the issue is specific to Change Healthcare and all other systems across UnitedHealth Group are operational,\" the spokesperson added. \"The disruption is expected to last at least through the day.\"\n\nThe company said it would share additional updates as more information becomes available.\n\nA family-owned pharmacy and two military pharmacies, in the Midwest and California, all reported on Wednesday and Thursday that network outages impacting national healthcare providers had prevented them from filling prescriptions.\n\nCanadian Lakes Pharmacy in Stanwood, Michigan, initially said in a social media post on Wednesday that it was unable to bill most insurance companies for prescriptions filled there due to what the pharmacy called a \"nationwide outage of some of the largest prescription processors\" in the country.\n\nBy Thursday morning, Canadian Lakes said in an updated post that it was able to fill prescriptions and bill them to most of its customers' insurance plans as usual.\n\nBut at least two other pharmacies alerted customers about prescription delays linked to network outages later on Thursday. In a social media post, 22nd Medical Group, which services the McConnell Air Force base in Kansas, said \"an unexpected enterprise-wide\" system outage meant the pharmacy could not process new prescriptions, though it would continue dispensing already-completed prescriptions.\n\nThe Naval Hospital at Camp Pendleton, a U.S. Marine Corps base in California, also reported issues filling prescriptions.\n\n\"Due to an ongoing enterprise-wide issue, all Camp Pendleton and associated pharmacies are unable to process any prescription claims,\" the hospital wrote in a social media post. \"We are only able to assist patients with emergency and urgent prescriptions from hospital providers at this time.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Walgreens said in a statement to CBS News that the pharmaceutical giant was not experiencing significant barriers to filling prescriptions, although a \"small percentage\" of prescriptions may be affected.\n\nFor the small percentage that may be affected, we have procedures in place so that we can continue to process and fill these prescriptions with minimal delay or interruption,\" the Walgreens spokesperson said.",

    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

    "title": "House GOP demand feds address migrants' use of airports as shelters: 'Unconscionable'",
    "body": "WASHINGTON (TND) -- House Republicans are demanding the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) address concerns surrounding migrants' use of airports as shelters.\n\nIn a letter Thursday, 37 GOP representatives provided FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker with a 30-day deadline to explain whether he has the power to allow use of airports for housing purposes and discuss how he can ensure facility operations are secure.\n\n\"It is imperative that the FAA operates within the bounds of the law and ensures that airports remain dedicated to their primary functions of facilitating air travel and commerce,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"We urge you to provide immediate answers to these pressing questions and take necessary steps to address this alarming situation.\"\n\nBoston Logan, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta and Chicago O'Hare airports have all hosted migrants as federal funding continues to stall in Congress. The Republicans expressed concern over the use of airports as shelters in contrast to their intended purposes.\n\n\"These airports are designed as crucial transportation hubs, facilitating the seamless movement of passengers and goods,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"It is troubling to observe taxpayer-funded facilities originally intended for air travel and commerce being repurposed to house illegal immigrants.\"\n\nREAD MORE | AOC jabs Biden for considering executive action at border: 'Doing Trump impressions'\n\nSafety worries also prompted the representatives' demands for answers, as they believe migrants' proximity to aviation infrastructure poses security risks.\n\n\"America's worst terror attack started at an airport - So it is unconscionable that the FAA is allowing unvetted illegal immigrants and potential terrorists to be housed in U.S. airports,\" Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas, said.\n\nAirports are \"intricately\" designed for the \"streamlined\" movement of passengers, aircraft and baggage, according to the representatives. They claimed large migrant populations would strain existing logistical frameworks.\n\n\"We are alarmed about the logistics and security implications of housing illegal immigrants within airport premises,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"The need for robust logistical and security structures is essential to ensure the integrity of both airport operations.\"\n\nA lack of response from Whitaker would undermine the U.S. immigration system and raise questions regarding the FAA's priorities, according to the representatives. Rep. Self blames liberal strategies for allowing airports to become overnight shelters.\n\n\"Democrats' lawless open border policies have turned American cities, schools and now airports into processing centers for illegal immigrants,\" he alleged. \"These troubling practices cannot continue.\"\n\nREAD MORE | NY governor claims GOP 'broke' border: 'I'm putting them on notice'\n\nCongress has struggled to pass an aid package despite the Senate's approval of a $95.3 billion proposal including provisions for the southern border. The Biden administration suggested it has contributed to progressing bills despite partisan pushback.\n\n\"The administration spent months negotiating in good faith to deliver the toughest and fairest bipartisan border security bill in decades because we need Congress to make significant policy reforms and to provide additional funding to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system,\" White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández told the Associated Press.\n\nHernández accused GOP members of putting their agenda ahead of safety concerns.\n\n\"Congressional Republicans chose to put partisan politics ahead of our national security, rejected what border agents have said they need and then gave themselves a two-week vacation,\" he said, according to the Associated Press.",

    "title": "Colorado ski town sells housing bonds in bid to retain teachers",
    "body": "Telluride, a ski resort destination in Colorado, is the first vacation town to sell municipal bonds for affordable housing this year.\n\nIt likely won't be the last.\n\nThe reason for last week's sale is immediately apparent by typing \"Homes for Sale Telluride Colorado\" in an internet browser. The websites that appear show that anyone wanting to buy a house there will need millions of dollars, maybe tens of millions.\n\nSo Telluride is \"prioritizing\" the acquisition and construction of affordable rental housing. Last week, Telluride School District R-1 borrowed $31.8 million, half of which will be used to pay for 25 units of \"workforce housing.\"\n\nThe wealthy ski area has tapped the bond market for similar reasons several times in recent years. Just last month the town borrowed $9 million, a portion of which is being used to pay to refurbish affordable housing at an apartment building. In 2022, the town council approved spending more than $27 million for a project containing another 27 units of affordable housing. Five years earlier, the school district borrowed $2.5 million for more of the same.\n\n\"If there are no homes, I can't fill positions,\" Christine Reich, director of finance and nutrition for the school district, said in a telephone interview.\n\nReich's words are echoed by local officials in vacation areas nationwide. Towns heavy on quaintness and charm but light on housing supply have squeezed out locals, both ordinary and essential purpose workers, from shop help to police, firefighters and teachers.\n\nLast year, the island of Nantucket off Cape Cod and the town of Wellfleet on the Cape each sold bonds for so-called workforce housing. Another Colorado ski town, Vail, did so in 2021. And it's not just vacation towns borrowing money to build affordable housing. Some colleges and universities, too, have sold bonds to pay for faculty housing, such as the University of Vermont and Middlebury College.\n\nIncome Gap\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\nIn Telluride, salaries in the school district range from an entry-level $50,000 to $94,665 for someone with a master's degree and 27 years of experience. But market-rate rentals in the town run from $4,000 to $5,000 per month for a one-bedroom apartment.\n\n\"We're remote,\" said Reich. \"It's not as though you can commute in from Denver,\" a 6½ hour drive away.\n\nOnly 55% of Telluride's housing is occupied by full-time residents, according to Treasure Walker, associate director at S&P Global Ratings. The remainder is typically used as short-term rentals and vacation homes in a town with a population of 2,620.\n\n\"There's a hyper supply-constrained environment,\" said Bill Fandel, the founding broker of Compass real estate in Telluride. He said that in a small town \"the cost of the dirt becomes prohibitive,\"referring to the space needed to build housing.\n\nThe school district, which is 326 square miles, includes the towns of Telluride, Ophir, Sawpit and Mountain Village and parts of unincorporated San Miguel County, and has a population of 6,515. It also has an \"exceptionally high\" full value per capita -- the value of all the property divided by the population -- of $2.1 million, according to Moody's Investors Service, which rates the bonds Aa2. The U.S. median is $117,713.\n\n\"The district is a second-home destination for the very wealthy,\" Moody's said. \"This, coupled with an influx of residents seeking an outdoor lifestyle during the pandemic, is driving a high cost of living and challenging the district's ability to recruit and retain teachers.\"\n\nThe school district currently provides housing to about 10% of its 136 full-time and 16 part-time personnel and wants to increase this to one-third. Base rents are 25% of salary.\n\nAlready there is a waiting list for the proposed affordable housing.\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99 Our journalism needs your support.

After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",

The outages, which began at approximately 3:30 a.m. ET, peaked at around 73,000 reported incidents. The carrier has more than 240 million subscribers, the country's largest.\n\nWhat is the SOS mode?\n\nSome AT&T iPhone customers saw SOS messages displayed in the status bar on their cellphones. The message indicates that the device is having trouble connecting to their cellular provider's network, but it can make emergency calls through other carrier networks, according to Apple Support.\n\nWhat is Wi-Fi calling?\n\nAT&T urged customers to connect to Wi-Fi to use their phones. Wi-Fi calling is a built-in feature on most Android devices and iPhones and can be turned on under the phone's settings.\n\n\"Some of our customers are experiencing wireless service interruptions this morning. We are working urgently to restore service to them. We encourage the use of Wi-Fi calling until service is restored,\" AT&T said in a statement.\n\nIf Wi-Fi isn't available, there are few options for cell phone users. It's possible to switch services if a phone is unlocked, but that requires signing up online and porting your phone number.\n\nSome apps, including Google Maps, have limited service offline. Payment apps also do not use a phone's cell service to work and should also be useable.\n\nWhat caused the outage?\n\nAT&T has stayed mum so far on what caused the outage.",

    "title": "Home sales rose in January as easing mortgage rates, more homes for sale enticed homebuyers",
    "body": "By ALEX VEIGA - AP Business Writer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in January as homebuyers were encouraged by easing mortgage rates and a modest pickup in properties on the market.\n\nExisting home sales rose 3.1% last month from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That's the strongest sales pace since August and is slightly higher than the 3.98 million sales pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.\n\nThe modest sales increase is an encouraging start for the housing market, which has been mired in a slump the past two years. Still, compared with January 2023, sales fell 1.7%. Existing home sales sank to a nearly 30-year low last year, tumbling 18.7% from 2022.\n\n\"While home sales remain sizably lower than a couple of years ago, January's monthly gain is the start of more supply and demand,\" said Lawrence Yun, the NAR's chief economist.\n\nThe pickup in sales helped push up home prices compared with a year earlier for the seventh month in a row. The national median sales price rose 5.1% from January last year to $379,100. That's the highest median sales price for January on records going back to 1999.\n\nFor the first time in 14 months, the median home sales price outpaced the 4.5% annual gain in U.S. wage growth recorded in January.\n\n\"It's unhealthy, we don't want to see it, but its a testament to the housing shortage we're facing in America,\" Yun said.\n\nCompetition for relatively few homes on the market and elevated mortgage rates have limited house hunters' buying power on top of years of soaring prices. That dynamic has helped keep home prices mostly rising despite weak home sales.\n\nThe cost of financing a home has largely come down from its most recent peak in late October, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage hit a 23-year high of 7.79%, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. But rates have been rising in recent weeks, with the average rate climbing this week to 6.90%, the highest level since mid-December.\n\n\"This is going to definitely impact the affordability for many people out there in the market place,\" Yun said. \"So, it's not good news.\"\n\nHomebuyers who could afford to sidestep mortgage rates altogether increasingly did so last month. Some 32% of the homes purchased last month were bought entirely with cash, the highest share in nearly 10 years, Yun noted.\n\nFirst-time homebuyers who don't have any home equity to put toward their down payment continued to have a tough time getting into the housing market. They accounted for just 28% of all homes sold last month. They've made up 40% of sales historically.\n\nA modest increase in the number of homes on the market helped lift sales. At the end of December, there were 1.01 million homes on the market, the NAR said. While that's a 3.1% increase from a year earlier, the number of available homes remains well below the monthly historical average of about 2.25 million.\n\nThe available inventory at the end of January amounted to a 3-month supply, going by the current sales pace. That's up 2% from the previous month and 3.1% January last year. In a more balanced market between buyers and sellers, there is a 4- to 6-month supply.\n\nWhile more homes typically hit the market in the spring, many homeowners that have locked in a mortgage rate well below where rates are today may opt to stay put rather than give up their rock-bottom rates. Some two-thirds of U.S. homes have a mortgage with a rate under 4% and more than 90% have a rate below 6%.",

    "body": "WINNIPEG - After ruling out more private-sector wind farms, Manitoba's NDP government said it will come up with a plan to fund new energy projects while also freezing hydroelectric rates and keeping its Crown-owned energy utility's debt load in check.\n\n\"We know we need new generation. We want that new generation to be publicly owned, and we have confidence in the (Manitoba Hydro) board and their ability to help deliver on that,\" Finance Minister Adrien Sala, who is responsible for Manitoba Hydro, told a legislature committee Thursday.\n\n×\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nSala's comments came the same day Manitoba Hydro reported more red ink in a quarterly fiscal update.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Crown utility is forecasting a $190-million net loss for the fiscal year that will end in March. That is $29 million higher than the loss predicted in the last quarterly update, and a big change from an original prediction of $450 million in net income last spring.\n\nThe change is due largely to drought conditions that have reduced water levels used to general power, along with other factors such as lower export prices and a warm autumn that reduced demand for heat.\n\nThe new numbers come at a time of turnover for Manitoba Hydro. The NDP government replaced the corporation's board after defeating the former Progressive Conservative government in the Oct. 3 election.\n\nThe NDP-appointed board then dismissed chief executive officer Jay Grewal, who had promoted a plan to use wind power from independent providers as a way to quickly meet growing energy demand.\n\nThe idea was not new. It had been mentioned by the previous board, and a former NDP government signed deals with two private wind farms more than a decade ago that continue to supply power to the province.\n\nGrewal had said Manitoba will need new energy production as early as 2029, and new Manitoba Hydro dams would not be built quickly enough or be as cost-effective as wind farms.\n\nThe Opposition Progressive Conservatives accused the NDP of rejecting the private wind-farm plan with no backup strategy.\n\n\"(The year) 2029 is only a few years away,\" Tory Obby Khan told the committee.\n\nSala said a plan will be drawn up.\n\n\"We are a new government. We're just getting started in developing the plans that need to be put forward,\" Sala said. He said the former Tory government did nothing to build generating capacity during its seven years in power.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nManitoba Hydro has appointed an interim chief executive officer, Hal Turner, while it seeks a replacement for Grewal. Turner told the committee no decisions have been made yet on new energy production, and Manitoba Hydro is also looking to ease the rise in demand.\n\n\"I am confident that when we work with this new board, we will find the appropriate path forward that will allow us to meet Manitobans' energy needs safely and affordably,\" Turner said.\n\nThe NDP campaigned on a promise to freeze rates for consumers for one year. Sala said that promise remains, and will be done sometime before the next election, scheduled for 2027.\n\n\"That's a commitment that we're planning on delivering on,\" he said.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 22, 2024.",

    "title": "RPT-UPDATE 2-US nears attempt at first moon landing in half century with private robot spacecraft",
    "body": "Feb 22 (Reuters) - A spacecraft built and flown by Houston-based company Intuitive Machines sailed around the moon on Thursday to attempt the first U.S. touchdown on the lunar surface in more than half a century and the first ever entirely by the private sector.\n\nThe six-legged robot lander, dubbed Odysseus, was due to begin the final descent from lunar orbit with a blast of its main engine about an hour before landing, with touchdown anticipated at 6:24 p.m. EST (2324 GMT) on Thursday, according to the company's latest flight plan.\n\nThe vehicle, targeting a crater named Malapert A near the moon's south pole, is carrying a suite of scientific instruments and technology demonstrations for NASA and several commercial customers designed to operate for seven days on solar energy before the sun sets over the polar landing site.\n\nThe NASA payload will focus on collecting data on space weather interactions with the moon's surface, radio astronomy and other aspects of the lunar environment for future landers and NASA's planned return of astronauts later in the decade.\n\nThe uncrewed spacecraft has been circling the moon about 57 miles (92 km) above the surface since reaching orbit on Wednesday, six days after it was launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nOdysseus remained \"in excellent health\" as it continued to orbit the moon, roughly 239,000 miles (384,000 km) from Earth, transmitting flight data and lunar images to Intuitive Machines' mission control center in Houston, the company said on Wednesday.\n\nIf the landing succeeds, the IM-1 mission would represent the first controlled descent to the lunar surface by a U.S. spacecraft since Apollo 17 in 1972, when NASA's last crewed moon mission landed there with astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt.\n\nTo date, spacecraft from just four other countries have ever landed on the moon - the former Soviet Union, China, India and, mostly recently, just last month, Japan. The United States is the only one ever to have sent humans to the lunar surface.\n\nDAWN OF ARTEMIS\n\nSuccess of Odysseus also would be the first \"soft landing\" on the moon ever by a commercially manufactured and operated vehicle and the first under NASA's Artemis lunar program, as the U.S. races to return astronauts to Earth's natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft there.\n\nNASA aims to land its first crewed Artemis in late 2026 as part of long-term, sustained lunar exploration and a stepping stone toward eventual human flights to Mars. The initiative focuses on the moon's south pole in part because a presumed bounty of frozen water exists there that can be used for life support and production of rocket fuel.\n\nA host of small landers like Odysseus are expected to pave the way under NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, designed to deliver instruments and hardware to the moon at lower costs than the U.S. space agency's traditional method of building and launching those vehicles itself.\n\nLeaning more heavily on smaller, less experienced private ventures comes with its own risks. Just last month the lunar lander of another firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak on its way to the moon shortly after being placed in orbit on Jan. 8 by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket making its debut flight.\n\nThe malfunction of Astrobotic's Peregrine lander marked the third failure of a private company to achieve a lunar touchdown, following ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan.\n\nAlthough Odysseus is the latest star of NASA's CLPS program, the IM-1 flight is considered an Intuitive Machines mission. The company was co-founded in 2013 by Stephen Altemus, former deputy director of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston and now the company's president and CEO.\n\nThe proliferation of commercial space ventures has itself been driven by leaps in technology in recent decades.\n\nThe Apollo program and robot lunar Surveyor missions that preceded it flew at the very dawn of the computer age, before the advent of modern microchips, electronic sensors and software, or the development of super light-weight metal alloys and myriad other advances that have spurred a revolution in spaceflight.

    "body": "JERUSALEM (AP) -- When the Biden administration imposed sanctions this month against Israeli settler Yinon Levi for allegedly assaulting Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, his supporters quickly sprang into action.\n\nWithin days, an online fundraiser collected over $140,000 for Levi and his unauthorized settler outpost from over 3,000 donors worldwide. Now, those contributions may be putting donors, crowdfunding sites and the financial services firms that process the payments at risk of penalties for violating the U.S. sanctions.\n\n\"It's not even a close call,\" said Britt Mosman, a former attorney at the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. government agency that enforces sanctions.\n\nShe said any American who donates money to a sanctioned person or group puts themself at risk. \"It is a pretty straightforward application of the sanctions prohibitions,\" she said.\n\nLevi is among seven hard-line settlers targeted this month by the U.S. and Britain for alleged attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank. The sanctions prevent them from accessing the U.S. financial system and expose them to an asset freeze, as well as travel and visa bans in the U.K. Israeli banks froze the settlers' personal bank accounts in response.\n\nIn Levi's case, funds from the crowdsourcing campaign, raised on the Israeli website Givechak, were collected by a nonprofit under the auspices of the Israeli settler council in the area.\n\n\"A few days ago, Yinon Levi's accounts were confiscated in a scandalous decision,\" read a note on the fundraising page before it was taken down. \"All donations will go to the further development of the farm and the land of Israel.\"\n\nSanctions experts say the order applies to U.S. citizens and companies involved in the campaigns -- and gives the U.S. government authority to blacklist Israeli entities allowing U.S. citizens or companies to violate sanctions. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network also alerted U.S. financial institutions against doing business with groups that support or have previously supported settler violence in the West Bank.\n\nTwo crowdfunding pages for sanctioned settlers have now been taken down.\n\nSome companies involved with the crowdfunding have taken action to disentangle themselves from the settlers, Israeli media said. Their reactions show how the U.S. and British sanctions, aimed at just a handful of individuals, could ripple widely in the intertwined global financial system.\n\nEitay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding campaigns have become crucial to raising money for settlement outposts. While Israel has established scores of settlements across the occupied territory, the outposts are not authorized, though the government gives them tacit support. The international community overwhelmingly considers all West Bank settlements illegal and obstacles to peace.\n\n\"This is a huge loophole that has been going on for years,\" Mack said. \"If the crowdfunding could be stopped, this could be a game changer. The outposts are not able to operate without this money.\"\n\nLevi founded Meitarim Farm in 2021 in the South Hebron Hills, according to a contract between him and the local regional council, shared with the Associated Press by anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. The outpost's development was helped by crowdsourcing -- a campaign on website JGive, started by a non-profit, raised nearly $6,000.\n\nAs the outpost developed, over 300 people from four nearby Palestinian hamlets fled their homes, citing violence by Levi and other settlers, Peace Now said.\n\nAfter the U.S. sanctions were announced, a fundraiser popped up on Givechak, run by the \"Mount Hebron Fund.\" Contact information listed a government email address, indicating it was linked to the Har Hebron Regional Council. The fund has an account with Bank Leumi, putting the bank at potential risk of U.S. penalties.\n\nThe fundraiser's contact was Levi's brother, Itamar, to whom Levi transferred ownership of a company he co-owned, apparently to try to skirt sanctions, Israeli media reported. Even after the page was taken down, Itamar Levi continued to accept donations to a Bank Leumi account, emails obtained by the AP showed.\n\nLevi, his brother, the fund and the council declined comment.\n\nGivechak does not divulge donors' whereabouts, but it is possible to donate from the U.S. Several donors wrote their names in English. The page was circulated on American social media platforms.\n\nA major donor was listed as Chaim Ben Pesach, head of an ultranationalist Jewish group designated as a terrorist organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ben Pesach posted the page to X, formerly Twitter, urging followers to \"help the heroes before we lose our sovereignty completely.\" Contacted by the AP, he denied making the 5,000 shekel ($1,500) donation, but said Levi's children were \"victims of the Biden administration's anti-Israel and antisemitic sanctions.\"\n\nAfter the page was taken down, a clearing company refused to transfer the funds to Levi's family, which filed a lawsuit to try to secure the money, according to legal documents shared with the AP by The Democratic Bloc, an Israeli NGO monitoring far-right groups.\n\nMany of the crowdfunding sites use the popular payment app Bit, owned by Israeli Bank Hapoalim. Bank spokesperson Sharona Levi declined to say whether the bank was taking measures -- only that it \"respects and complies with international sanctions.\"\n\nHashomer Yosh, a government-funded group that sends volunteers to work on West Bank farms, both legal and illegal, sent volunteers to Levi's outpost, a Nov. 13 Facebook post said. It linked to a JGive page recruiting \"armed volunteers\" that raised nearly $24,000.\n\nJGive took down a fundraising page on its site for Levi's outpost after the AP requested comment, and said it had blocked donations in compliance with the sanctions order. It said other campaigns were \"in full compliance with all and any applicable laws and regulations.\"\n\nYehuda Shaffer, an international expert on sanctions and former deputy state attorney of Israel, said he didn't think the U.S. would go after Israeli banks for their involvement in crowdfunding campaigns. The sanctions appear more like \"lip service\" to address Palestinian concerns, he said.\n\n\"My feeling is that this is much less serious than Ukrainian sanctions,\" he said.\n\nShaffer said it was more likely the banks would cut ties with groups that enable sanctions violations to maintain good relations with American banks and avoid risk.\n\nA fundraiser for David Chai Chasdai, another settler sanctioned by the U.S., raised $2,500 on the New York-based site Charidy. The page was taken down after the AP requested comment.\n\nThe Biden order said Chasdai \"initiated and led\" a violent rampage last year in the Palestinian town of Hawara by scores of Israeli settlers who set dozens of cars and homes on fire after two settlers were killed by a Palestinian gunman.\n\nThe group collecting funds on Charidy is listed as Shlom Asiraich, which raises money for imprisoned Jewish extremists. The crowdfunding site has been shared in at least one WhatsApp group, on X and on Facebook.\n\nMack, the human rights lawyer, said crowdfunding has significantly bolstered settler outposts.\n\nIn 2022, he wrote to European Union authorities seeking sanctions against Moshe Sharvit, a settler sanctioned by Britain. After Israeli media published Mack's letter, Sharvit's family turned to crowdfunding, raising $133,878. The Givechak page remains up.\n\nIsrael's Bank Supervisor rejected a request from Mack to prevent the transfer of funds to Sharvit, saying it was a \"political security issue\" not under its jurisdiction.\n\nIsraeli media reported Sunday that Paybox, a payment app, had suspended Sharvit's account.\n\nGivechak and Charidy declined comment.\n\nThe sanctions may also impact prominent Jewish organizations like the Jewish National Fund, a 120-year-old group known for acquiring land, planting trees and carrying out development projects in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\nHaaretz reported in October that JNF spent over $1.1 million over the past two years for programs for troubled youth working on unauthorized outposts, including Sharvit's.\n\nJNF told the AP it didn't support the \"operation of the farms or the owners of the farms and certainly not the activities of the farm of Moshe Sharvit directly, only the at-risk youths.\"\n\n-- -- --\n\nMelanie Lidman contributed reporting from Jerusalem.",
