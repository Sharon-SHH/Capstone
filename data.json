    "title": "A small drone flies into a damaged Fukushima reactor for the first time to study its melted fuel",
    "body": "TOKYO (AP) -- A drone small enough to fit in one's hand flew inside one of the damaged reactors at the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant Wednesday in hopes it can examine some of the molten fuel debris in areas where earlier robots failed to reach.\n\nTokyo Electric Power Company Holdings also began releasing the fourth batch of the plant's treated and diluted radioactive wastewater into the sea Wednesday. The government and TEPCO, the plant's operator, say the water is safe and the process is being monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but the discharges have faced strong opposition by fishing groups, as well as a Chinese ban on Japanese seafood.\n\nA magnitude 9.0 quake and tsunami in March 2011 destroyed the plant's power supply and cooling systems, causing three reactors to melt down. The government and TEPCO plan to remove the massive amount of fatally radioactive melted nuclear fuel that remains inside each reactor -- a daunting decommissioning process that's already been delayed for years and mired by technical hurdles and a lack of data.\n\nTo help fill in that data, a fleet of four drones were set to fly one at a time into the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel.\n\nTEPCO has sent a number of probes -- including a crawling robot and an underwater vehicle -- inside each of the three reactors, but got hindered by debris, high radiation and inability to navigate them through the rubble, though they were able to gather some data in recent years.\n\nIn 2015, the first robot to go inside the reactor got stuck on a grate. Some helpful information came from the mission, but the crawling robot had to be abandoned.\n\nWednesday's drone flight comes after months of preparations and training that began in July at a nearby mockup facility outside of the plant.\n\nThe drones, each weighing only 185 grams (6.5 ounces), are highly maneuverable and the blades hardly stir up dust, making it a popular model for factory safety checks. It's nearly a square of about 18 centimeters (7 inches) on both sides, 5 centimeters (2 inches) thick, and carries a front-loaded high definition camera to send live video and a higher-quality images to an operating room.\n\nIn part due to battery life, the drone investigation inside of the reactor is limited to a 5-minute flight each.\n\nTEPCO officials said they plan to use the new data to develop technology for future probes as well as a process to remove the melted fuel from the reactor in the coming years. The data will also be used in the investigation of how exactly the 2011 meltdown occurred.\n\nFirst, two drones were to inspect the area around the exterior of the main structural support in the vessel, called the pedestal, before deciding if the other two could be sent inside to the area previous probes could not reach.\n\nThe pedestal is directly under the reactor's core. Officials hope to film the core's bottom to find out how overheated fuel dripped there in 2011.\n\nAbout 880 tons of highly radioactive melted nuclear fuel remain inside the three damaged reactors. Critics say the 30- to 40-year cleanup target set by the government and TEPCO for Fukushima Daiichi is overly optimistic. The damage in each reactor is different, and plans need to be formed to accommodate their conditions.\n\nTEPCO's goal is to remove a small amount of melted debris from the least-damaged No. 2 reactor as a test case by the end of March by using a giant robotic arm, but was forced to delay due to difficulty removing a deposit blocking its entry. That monthslong postponement comes in addition to its already nearly two-year delay, underscoring the difficulty and uncertainty of the decommissioning process.",

In his latest report Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Advisor said, \"Factoring the slight decline in economic activity in Q3 FY24, we estimate that the GDP should grow in the range of 6.7-6.9 per cent with a gross value added (GVA) growth of 6.6 per cent.\"\n\nThe SBI Composite Leading Indicator (CLI) Index (a basket of 41 leading indicators which includes parameters from almost all the sectors) based on monthly data shows a slight moderation in economic activity in Q3.\n\nAccording to Ghosh, the estimates are corroborated with the in-house developed SBI-ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model, with 30 high-frequency indicators.\n\nThe ANN has been trained for the quarterly GDP data from 2011Q4 to 2020Q4 and the in-sample forecast performance of the model in the training period has been precise.\n\nAs a counter narrative to the global gloom, consumer confidence has strengthened further in India, driven chiefly by optimism about the general economic situation and employment conditions.\n\nVarious enterprise surveys also point towards strong business optimism, Ghosh said.\n\nCorporate India has continued its robust performance buoyed by incrementally accelerating consumption patterns across the urban-rural landscape.\n\nCorporate results, as recorded from around 4,000 listed entities, for Q3FY24, shows robust growth of more than 30 per cent in both EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and profit after tax (PAT), while top line grew by around 7 per cent as compared to Q3FY23, the report said.\n\nFurther, listed entities reported improvement in margin, as reflected in results of around 3,000 listed entities ex-BFSI, with EBIDTA margin of 14.95 per cent, on aggregate basis, during Q3 FY24 as compared to around 12 per cent during the same period the previous year.\n\nCorporate GVA, as measured by EBIDTA plus employee expenses, reported a strong growth of around 26 per cent in Q3FY24 as compared to Q3FY23, Ghosh said.\n\nAs per First Advance Estimates, the estimated production of major Kharif crops for 2023-24 is 148.5 million metric ton (MMT), a decline of about 4.6 per cent from FY23.\n\n\"While, the sowing season for Rabi crops that concluded on February 23, indicates a slight increase in overall acreage compared to the previous year. However, concerns arose over the sown area under cereals, which saw a decline of 6.5 per cent from the previous year,\" Ghosh said.\n\nWhile agriculture may see some moderation if the Rabi output does not offset the Kharif shortfall, value added in agriculture will decline.\n\nThe inland fish production has shown a rapid growth from 2014-15 to 2022-23 and reached 131.13 lakh tonnes in 2022-23.\n\nThe share of fisheries sector constitutes about 1.07 per cent of the total national GVA and 6.86 per cent of agricultural GVA.\n\nSo, this might support the agriculture and allied sector growth in FY24, Ghosh said.",

    "body": "HDFC Bank has been conscious in not accepting high-cost deposits, which have resulted in slower growth in October-December, said Sashidhar Jagdishan, managing director and chief executive officer, during an interaction with Goldman Sachs recently.\n\nIMAGE: Sashidhar Jagdishan, managing director and CEO, HDFC Bank. Photograph: Kind courtesy TERumel/wikipedia.org/Creative Commons, background image Shailesh Andrade/Reuters\n\nHe said during times of tight liquidity, short terms hardened, as was the case in October-December.\n\n\"Not only did we participate, but we also gave up which came up for maturity,\" he said.\n\nHDFC Bank shares came under pressure after the October-December earnings numbers due to slower than expected growth in deposits and compression in the net interest margin.\n\nThe share price recovered in the past one week and closed at Rs 1,453.75 on February 20, up 2.6 per cent from the previous close.\n\n\"That (letting away deposits) will mean it will be way below expectations .... as we say one swallow does not make a summer - it was said in a positive aspect, (but) I am saying it in the reverse aspect. It does now mean we have a problem,\" Jagdishan said.\n\nIn the third quarter, the largest private-sector bank's deposits grew by Rs 40,000 crore as compared to Rs 1.1 trillion in the second quarter this financial year.\n\nBanking-system liquidity, which was surplus for a long period, turned deficit by the middle of September and stayed that way during Q3.\n\nSlower accretion to deposits will not affect the bank's profitability, Jagdishan said.\n\nHe said the bank has been adding 50-60 basis points of incremental share in deposits a year.\n\nThat translates into 15-20 per cent quarterly growth, which is higher than the deposit market share, now 10-11 per cent.\n\nThe liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of the lender sharply declined to 110 per cent in Q3FY24 from 120 per cent in Q2FY24, which caused concern among investors.\n\nJagdishan said an LCR of 110-120 per cent was respectable and healthy, given the size of the bank.\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 2023, the loan-deposit ratio (LDR) of the bank stood at 110 per cent.\n\nThe pre-merger LDR levels were 85-90 per cent, which the bank expects to maintain.\n\nHe said the merger of the two entities -- HDFC Ltd and HDFC Bank -- advanced the timing of loan growth for the lender.\n\nTo the question on the bank's relation with Paytm and the recent regulatory action against Paytm Payments Bank, Jadgishan said, \"Whatever has happened is rather unfortunate so obviously there is a certain little bit of an unknown.\"\n\nHe said the fintech had a good tech platform, which is the reason why the bank (HDFC Bank) had a partnership with it.\n\nHe said HDFC Bank had a reasonable FASTag market share, which may get distributed among other players following the ban on FASTags of Paytm Payments Bank.",

    "body": "The warmup this week has all of us thinking spring, and on the farm the weather makes planting time appear to be right around the corner. In fact, planters will be rolling before we know it, especially with many farmers planting soybeans earlier in recent years.\n\n\"Which means they're going into maybe a little bit colder, wetter soils in the springtime and what we end up looking at is we need to make sure that we're protecting that seed coming out of the bag going into the ground,\" says Clint Chaffer Asgrow Brand Manager. \"So a product like our Acceleron Seed Applied Solutions makes sure that we're really coating that seed and giving it the best chance of emergence.\"\n\nChaffer says farmers are seeing the benefit of those earlier plant dates.\n\n\"Because we're putting in that seed earlier, we're giving that plant more time to absorb that sunlight and hopefully turn into yield. You pair that up with 100% exclusive genetics from Asgrow, just coming out of our robust pipeline, all the innovation, research and development that goes into these products, they're just more resilient. They're able to go through a lot of those stressful factors and really come out of the ground and be able to really put those soybeans, put those pods on and end up yielding the way that we want them to yield in the end.\"\n\nLast year was another typical year of weather challenges facing corn and soybean plants. Thanks to an extensive research and development pipeline, there were many successes.\n\n\"Asgrow selects the best of the best products coming out of that pipeline each and every year,\" he said. \"We were really excited for our XF3 class that was really one of the first products that we started seeing out of our latest generation of our breeding program, and so this XF4 class is the next generation coming out and we're seeing even better results coming from that class.\"",

Like last week or two weeks ago, he didn't get home until almost six one day. So it's just been very inconsistent,\" said Michele Austin, SLPS parent.\n\nAustin's neighborhood consistently sees issues with getting kids to and from school.

How do they work?\n\n\"There are multiple parents who have Airtags in their kids backpacks cause the bus doesn't always take the same route and the bus isn't always on time,\" Austin said.\n\nHer neighborhood relies heavily on carpooling, and have even started a text thread.\n\n\"Even when the bus was on track and on schedule, the app wasn't always tracking the right bus. you might be waiting five minutes; you might be waiting 45 minutes,\" said Alison Long, SLPS parent.\n\nAccording to a release, 56 routes were uncovered Tuesday morning due to the walk-out.\n\n\"We at Saint Louis Public Schools (SLPS) remain extremely disappointed by the fact that thousands of children and their families are being adversely impacted by a driver walkout against the Missouri Central Bus Company,\" said a statement from Saint Louis Public Schools. \"It is also our hope that leadership at Missouri Central Bus Company and their drivers can find common ground on how to solve their problems.

    "body": "Tens of thousands of residents in Australia's southeast were told to evacuate on Wednesday due to an intense heatwave that authorities said could further spread a massive bushfire in Victoria state, which faces its worst conditions in four years.\n\nExtreme fire ratings have been issued for large parts of Victoria with the Wimmera region in the west given a catastrophic ranking, the top warning level. Mildura, a rural city of about 56,000, could touch 45 degree Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), the Bureau of Meteorology said.\n\nA potential fire impact zone that covers several rural towns has been identified as officials urged around 30,000 residents there to leave their homes by Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Today will be a very challenging day for firefighters,\" Jason Heffernan, Chief Officer at Victoria fire department told ABC television. \"Today is one of those days when communities may need to take immediate action at very short notice.\"\n\nHundreds of firefighters were still battling a massive blaze near the city of Ballarat, 95 km (60 miles) west of Melbourne. The fire, burning since last Thursday, has already destroyed six homes, killed livestock and burnt more than 20,000 hectares (200 square kilometres).\n\nA heat wave is set to sweep in from Australia's outback interior, moving across Victoria before likely shifting east to the state of New South Wales on Thursday. Total fire bans are in place across several cities, including Melbourne.\n\nDry lightning could spark new fires while strong winds forecast from Wednesday afternoon could spread the existing one near Ballarat, Heffernan said.\n\nHeffernan urged people to reconsider any decision to stay back to protect their homes.\n\n\"Unless your property is immaculately prepared and you have firefighting resources available and you are fit and you are mentally capable to sustain a long duration firefight ... my strong advice to the community is to leave early,\" he said.",

    "body": "Mobile customers face having to choose between \"huge\" mid-contract price rises or \"crippling\" exit fees from April, a watchdog has warned. Ofcom recently proposed a ban on the practice of inflation-linked mid-contract price rises, saying that they cause \"substantial consumer harm\", but this will not come into effect before the next wave of hikes in April.\n\nWhich? said Virgin Media and O2 were expected to go ahead with price increases of up to 8.8% this April - the latest RPI figure of 4.9% plus an \"arbitrary\" 3.9% - the highest hikes in percentage terms out of any of the major firms. The alternative for those under contract was an exit fee, which could be \"exorbitant\", it said.\n\nWhich? analysis suggested that a customer with Virgin Media for their broadband and O2 for their mobile could face a combined exit fee as high as £692.37 if 12 months were still remaining on their contracts. Since the companies merged, Virgin Mobile customers have been migrated to O2 and the providers have begun offering bundled deals.\n\nWhich? also said its calculations suggested an in-contract Virgin Media customer could see their annual broadband bill increase by £39.14, or face an exit fee of £403.91 if they were to leave their contract 12 months early. Ofcom's latest complaints figures showed Virgin Media was the most complained-about broadband, landline and pay-TV provider and received just one star for customer service in Which?'s annual broadband provider rankings.\n\nMeanwhile the average O2 sim-only mobile customer faces a £26.44 annual price hike, the highest increase of any network by percentage but slightly less than Vodafone, which has higher prices overall on average, the watchdog calculated. Which? said the average in-contract sim-only O2 customer currently paid around £25.04 a month, but would face an exit fee of £288.46 if they were to leave their contract 12 months early.\n\nVirgin Media O2 said customers faced increases of \"up to\" 8.8%, because the additional 3.9% increase on top of RPI would not be added to the bills of \"millions\" of customers, and it only applied price increases to customers' airtime plans, not their device plans. The average effective mobile price increase would be 5%, not 8.8%, it said.\n\nOfcom is currently reviewing inflation-linked, mid-contract price rises but is yet to publish its final decision on its proposals to ban the practice. Which? director of policy and advocacy Rocio Concha said: \"Virgin Media and O2 customers face a lose-lose choice between huge price hikes and crippling exit fees. This comes on top of up to 17% increases faced by some O2 customers last year - few would have anticipated such steep price rises when they signed up.\n\n\"Ofcom has clearly stated that the practice of inflation-linked mid contract price rise terms can cause substantial consumer harm. Telecoms firms must do the right thing and immediately scrap these rises, rather than cynically taking the opportunity to cash in one last time at the expense of their customers before new rules take effect.\"\n\nA Virgin Media O2 spokesman said: \"2023 was a record year for traffic on our networks as customers used our mobile and broadband services more than ever. We are investing heavily to ensure we continue to provide the fast and reliable connectivity our customers rely on, and the amount we receive from price increases is greatly outweighed by the £5 million we invest every single day to upgrade our networks and services to give customers a better overall experience.\n\n\"Which?'s own analysis shows that we continue to offer excellent value, with cable customers paying an average of just 10p more per day, and mobile customers facing an effective average increase of just 5p a day, for services they're using almost constantly.\n\n\"This is further backed up by recent independent analysis which found that the cost of telecoms services has fallen by a fifth since 2017, while at the same time speeds and usage have increased significantly.\"",

Revenue from profits tax and salaries tax is HK$171.2 billion and HK$79.2 billion respectively.\n\nThe revised estimate of total government expenditure for 2023-24 is HK$727.9 billion, decreased by 10.2 percent compared to the previous year.\n\nChan also noted that the government revenue for 2024-25 is estimated to be HK$633 billion, while earnings and profits tax are estimated to be HK$279.6 billion, increasing by 6.8 percent.\n\nTaking into account the bond issuance of HK$120 billion in 2024-25, it is expected that there will be a deficit of HK$48.1 billion for the year, and fiscal reserves will decrease to HK$685.1 billion, down HK$48.1 billion.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the external environment will remain complicated in the coming year.

    "title": "Rye bread remains a Finnish favourite - one in three Finns eats rye bread every day",
    "body": "The national rye bread day is celebrated today, 28 February. Rye is an inseparable part of Finnish culinary culture, and Finns eat the most rye in the world with more than 15 kilograms per person annually 1). According to a survey 2) commissioned by Fazer Bakery Finland, the consumption of rye bread is experiencing a slight increase.\n\nRye bread is chosen for its excellent taste\n\nAccording to a survey commissioned by Fazer, four in five Finns eat rye bread at least weekly. For a third of Finns, it is part of their daily diet. By far the most important reason for eating rye bread is its excellent taste: 80 percent of Finns feel this way. Significant selection criteria also include its healthiness (69 percent) and rye bread being a great source of fibre (63 percent).\n\nThe popularity of rye bread is not showing any signs of slowing down, rather the opposite. One in four survey respondents says they are eating slightly or significantly more rye bread compared to a year ago.\n\n\"It's great that rye bread is still a favourite among Finns. We are keeping the strong rye tradition alive and bake our rye bread with Finnish rye in the world's largest rye bakery in Lahti. At the same time, we are continuously developing new rye products that match the Finnish taste. Rye bread is the single most important source of wholegrain in our diet and an easy way to meet the daily recommendation of 90 grams of wholegrain given in the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations,\" says Marko Bergholm, Managing Director at Fazer Bakery Finland.\n\nRye bread gives energy for daily life\n\nDaily life is bursting with moments where good energy is needed. Research shows that rye bread is an essential ingredient in Finns' breakfast and evening snack spreads. One in two Finns chooses rye bread as their snack when at home and one in three as their on-the-go snack. The survey also discovered that Finns like to enjoy their rye bread topped with cheese, cold cuts, and cucumber.\n\nRye is the most important source of wholegrain in Finland, and rye bread is the most important individual source of wholegrain. Rye products are also an excellent source of fibre, and Finns get about a quarter of their daily fibre intake from rye. In addition, rye is a great source of plant protein and true brainfood as its nutrients - iron, zinc, and magnesium among others - maintain normal brain function as part of a balanced and varied diet and healthy lifestyle.\n\n\"A life-long relationship\"\n\nAccording to the survey commissioned by Fazer, Finns link plenty of memories, emotions, and impressions to rye bread.\n\nOne in two respondents said that rye bread brings back memories. Most of them are connected to childhood and cosy moments at home. In many memories, rye bread is also associated with the important people in your life, such as parents, grandparents, own children, and friends. Finns also make a connection between rye bread and looking after the ones you love: two in three Finns feel that making someone a sandwich is a sign of caring.\n\nFinns also think that by eating rye bread they can access a state of mind that can be described as cosy, energetic, and safe. Respondents told about their habits and situations related to consuming rye bread in which the good energy provided by rye bread is particularly important.\n\n2) Rye bread survey 2024 / Norstat, N = 1,020: The survey commissioned by Fazer Bakery Finland was conducted by Norstat on 24-29 January 2024. The survey was answered by 1,020 Finns, aged 18-74.\n\nFazer is the bakery industry market leader in Finland. Fazer's large bakeries are located in Vantaa, Lahti and Lappeenranta, Finland. The company has nearly 140 in-store bakeries within grocery shops where artisanal bakers make bread by hand in the shop premises using Finnish flour. In Finland, Fazer Bakeries employs approximately 1,600 people. In the manufacturing of the bakery products, approximately 92 per cent of the ingredients are Finnish.\n\nFazer Group\n\nFazer, The Food Experience Company, enables people to enjoy the best moments of their day.

All parties continue to communicate with the related ministries and as far as we know the process is nearing completion,\" CEO Patrick Walujo said in an online briefing.\n\nIndonesian minister for small and medium enterprises Teten Masduki said last week TikTok had yet to comply with the regulation.\n\nTikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Following December's deal, TikTok has reopened its e-commerce services, which are now facilitated by Tokopedia.\n\nGoTo's management said in the briefing that it will receive a quarterly e-commerce fee from Tokopedia, with the sum being dependent on Tokopedia's gross merchandise value.\n\nBased on a GMV of $2.9 billion recorded in the third quarter of last year, the e-commerce service fee for GoTo will be $11.4 million, GoTo said.\n\nGoTo also expects its partnership with TikTok will benefit not only its e-commerce business but also its financial services segment as it will be able to offer digital payments and \"buy now, pay later\" credit schemes on TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stefanno Sulaiman and Stanley Widianto; Editing by Kanupriya Kapoor and Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

It said the vessel was heading toward China with cargo sent by Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics.\n\nThe department has accused the ministry of facilitating the delivery of Iranian weapons, in particular drones, to Russia, which has been using them in its war against Ukraine. The weapons have also been delivered to Iran-backed militias in the Middle East.\n\nHong Kong-registered Kohana Co. was blacklisted for owning the vessel and Marshall Islands-registered Iridescent Co Ltd. was hit for being its operator.\n\n\"Iran's Ministry of Defense is engaged in a series of schemes to fund destabilizing activities that range from supplying militia groups with weapons used to attack U.S. forces to aiding Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said Tuesday in a statement.\n\n\"Treasury will continue to disrupt the illicit revenue-generation efforts that support these destabilizing acts.\"\n\nThe sanctions came as the United States and Britain jointly targeted the Iran-backed Houthi militia with blacklistings over its attacks on their military vessels as well as commercial ships in the Red Sea.\n\n\"The United States and its allies remain committed to countering terrorist financing and will continue to use all available means to disrupt Houthi attacks on international shipping in the region,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said in a statement.\n\nThe sanctions freeze all property and interests in property of those blacklisted while barring U.S. persons from doing business with them.",

Project Titan was set to have self-driving capabilities, a limousine-esque interior, and voice-based navigation.\n\n5 reasons Apple scrapped its EV\n\nProject Titan was a multi-billion dollar effort that Apple had been working on since 2014. However, Apple reportedly made the decision to pull the plug for five reasons, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe strategy for Apple's EV car is built on a house of cards; it's constantly changing with no consistent plan nor approach.There has been a revolving door of leadership. In other words, the turnover rate for people at the helm of Project Titan leadership was reportedly high.The EV is still years away from hitting the proverbial store shelves, which concerned Apple. It was spending \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year\" on a car that may never come to market, Bloomberg said.Self-driving technology is tricky and challenging.The EV market has been stagnating due to poor charging infrastructure, which soured Apple's optimism.\n\nHowever, if any company can revive an industry, it'd be Apple. As a VR enthusiast, I've noticed a surge of AR/VR interest with the release of Apple Vision Pro unlike what I've seen before (despite the Meta Quest 3's envelope-pushing capabilities).\n\nApple's EV was reportedly poised to be priced at around $100,000. Project Titan staffers who remain after the layoffs will work under John Giannandrea, Apple's senior vice president of Machine Learning and AI Strategy.",

    "title": "Why does the US government think a Kroger-Albertsons merger would be bad for grocery shoppers?",
    "body": "Kroger and Albertsons -- two of the biggest grocery chains in the United States -- had hoped to complete the largest supermarket merger in the country's history this year. But their plan to compete with big-box retailers by combining forces faces legal challenges that make it look far less likely, at least any time soon.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against Kroger's $24.6 billion deal to acquire Albertsons and a federal lawsuit that asks a judge to block the merger for now. Attorneys general from eight states and the District of Columbia joined the lawsuit lodged in Oregon.\n\nHere's what to know about the proposed merger, what it might mean for shoppers -- and why the U.S. government opposes it.\n\nMost Americans have filled a basket at an Albertsons or a Kroger store even if the sign out front had a different name. Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The company's 19 brands include Ralphs, Smith's, King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, Mariano's, Pick 'n Save and Harris Teeter. Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates 2,273 stores in 34 states. Its 15 brands include Safeway, Jewel Osco, Vons, Acme and Shaw's. Together, Kroger and Albertsons employ around 700,000 people.\n\nCities where Kroger-owned and Albertsons-owned stores now vie for customers include Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago and the District of Columbia.\n\nSome labor unions and consumer advocacy groups predict the merger would result in store closures, leaving communities with fewer grocery options and giving Kroger-Albertsons fewer incentives to keep prices down.\n\n\"A merger of Kroger and Albertsons would dramatically decrease competition within an already consolidated food retail market, which would result in fewer grocery stores and higher food prices, with predictable adverse consequences for food and nutrition security for consumers across the country,\" Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said in a statement applauding the FTC's action.\n\nKroger says no stores would close as a result of the merger. It also promises to invest $1.3 billion to update Albertsons' existing outlets. But in some places, stores would get sold to a new owner. To stave off monopoly concerns from federal regulators, Kroger and Albertsons agreed to sell 413 stores and eight distribution centers in locations where their operations overlap.\n\nThe buyer would be C&S Wholesale Grocers, a grocery supplier that also owns the Piggly Wiggly brand. But the FTC says the divestiture deal is \"inadequate\" and the proposal doesn't contain enough stores or other resources to replicate the competition that currently exists between Albertsons and Kroger.\n\nKroger and Albertsons agreed to merge in October 2022. The companies said a merger would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, because they would have more power to negotiate prices and could save on distribution and administrative costs. Together, they would control around 13% of the U.S. grocery market; Walmart now controls 22%, while Costco controls 6%, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman.\n\nThe FTC says the deal would eliminate the competition that now exists between Kroger and Albertsons, and without competition, buyers would see higher prices, lower quality and fewer shopping choices. In a separate lawsuit filed earlier this month, Colorado's attorney general gave a specific example. The city of Gunnison, Colorado, has two groceries: Kroger-owned City Market and Albertsons-owned Safeway. The merger would make Kroger the only chain operating in this area, and a Gunnison resident would have to drive 65 miles to a non-Kroger store.\n\nConsumers also would see fewer deals if the stores merged since Kroger and Albertsons currently use promotions to lure shoppers away from the competition, according to the FTC. The agency also foresees less incentive for stores to add or improve services. When Albertsons executives saw unstaffed deli counters at Kroger's Fred Meyer stores, for example, they added counter staff at their stores. In the same way, Kroger improved its grocery pickup services in some markets to compete with Albertsons.\n\nThe FTC says competition at supermarket pharmacy counters also benefits consumers. When Kroger went out-of-network with a major pharmacy benefits administrator last year, for example, Albertsons offered consumers a $75 grocery coupon to transfer their prescriptions.\n\nKroger says it wouldn't, and that it would invest $500 million to lower prices across its stores once the deal goes into effect. GlobalData, a market research firm, said discount chains like Aldi and cost-conscious competitors like Walmart would help keep prices in check even if Kroger and Albertsons combined.\n\nBut the FTC isn't convinced. In a 2012 study, FTC economists found that prices increased more than 2% when grocers merged in places where they had little competition. Prices only decreased or stayed the same in markets where grocers had more competitors.\n\nKroger promised to boost wages and benefits by $1 billion if the deal goes through. C&S Wholesale Grocers said it would honor all collective bargaining agreements with Kroger and Albertsons workers if it takes over QFC, Mariano's, Carrs and other stores.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents most workers at both companies, voted last year to oppose the merger, saying the companies hadn't been transparent about how it would impact workers. Not all workers are opposed to the deal, however. UFCW Local 555, which represents grocery workers in Oregon and Idaho, said earlier this month that it supports the Kroger and Albertsons merger because it trusts C&S to operate the stores in its area.\n\nThe attorneys general of Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Wyoming and the District of Columbia filed the federal lawsuit along with the FTC. The attorneys general of Colorado and Washington previously filed their own lawsuits seeking to block the merger.\n\nKroger and Albertsons can file a response to the FTC's administrative complaint within 14 days. A hearing has been set for July 31. While the case winds its way through the agency's legal process, the FTC wants a federal judge to issue a temporary injunction barring the merger. Kroger and Albertsons have said they will appeal any adverse rulings.",

    "title": "India's Q3FY24 GDP to grow 6.7% - 6.9%: SBI",
    "body": "CHENNAI: India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) should grow in the region of 6.7-6.9 per cent during the third quarter (Q3) of FY24, said a top economist with the State Bank of India (SBI).\n\nIn his latest report Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Advisor said, \"Factoring the slight decline in economic activity in Q3 FY24, we estimate that the GDP should grow in the range of 6.7-6.9 per cent with a gross value added (GVA) growth of 6.6 per cent.\"\n\nThe SBI Composite Leading Indicator (CLI) Index (a basket of 41 leading indicators which includes parameters from almost all the sectors) based on monthly data shows a slight moderation in economic activity in Q3.\n\nAccording to Ghosh, the estimates are corroborated with the in-house developed SBI-ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model, with 30 high-frequency indicators.\n\nThe ANN has been trained for the quarterly GDP data from 2011Q4 to 2020Q4 and the in-sample forecast performance of the model in the training period has been precise.\n\nAs a counter narrative to the global gloom, consumer confidence has strengthened further in India, driven chiefly by optimism about the general economic situation and employment conditions.\n\nVarious enterprise surveys also point towards strong business optimism, Ghosh said.\n\nCorporate India has continued its robust performance buoyed by incrementally accelerating consumption patterns across the urban-rural landscape.\n\nCorporate results, as recorded from around 4, 000 listed entities, for Q3FY24, shows robust growth of more than 30 per cent in both EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) and profit after tax (PAT), while top line grew by around 7 per cent as compared to Q3FY23, the report said.\n\nFurther, listed entities reported improvement in margin, as reflected in results of around 3, 000 listed entities ex-BFSI, with EBIDTA margin of 14.95 per cent, on aggregate basis, during Q3 FY24 as compared to around 12 per cent during the same period the previous year.\n\nCorporate GVA, as measured by EBIDTA plus employee expenses, reported a strong growth of around 26 per cent in Q3FY24 as compared to Q3FY23, Ghosh said.\n\nAs per First Advance Estimates, the estimated production of major Kharif crops for 2023-24 is 148.5 million metric ton (MMT), a decline of about 4.6 per cent from FY23.\n\n\"While, the sowing season for Rabi crops that concluded on February 23, indicates a slight increase in overall acreage compared to the previous year. However, concerns arose over the sown area under cereals, which saw a decline of 6.5 per cent from the previous year, \" Ghosh said.\n\nWhile agriculture may see some moderation if the Rabi output does not offset the Kharif shortfall, value added in agriculture will decline.\n\nThe inland fish production has shown a rapid growth from 2014-15 to 2022-23 and reached 131.13 lakh tonnes in 2022-23.\n\nThe share of fisheries sector constitutes about 1.07 per cent of the total national GVA and 6.86 per cent of agricultural GVA.\n\nSo, this might support the agriculture and allied sector growth in FY24, Ghosh said.",

    "title": "Disruptions In Panama, Suez Affect More Than 10% Of Global LNG Trade",
    "body": "Oxford study shows 8% of global LNG exports in 2023 were delivered via Suez Canal and 2.5% via Panama Canal.\n\nDisruptions in transit via the Panama and Suez Canals affected the equivalent of just over 10% of global LNG trade but did not prevent shipping between the Atlantic and Pacific Basins, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES) on Tuesday.\n\nA study from OIES showed that 8% of global LNG exports in 2023 were delivered via the Suez Canal and 2.5% via the Panama Canal.\n\nThe institute said that, due to droughts and restrictions on vessel transport through the Panama Canal, the volume of LNG shipments declined by two-thirds between August 2023 and January 2024. It also forecasted that shipments could fall to zero in February, owing to Houthi attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, which meant that no LNG cargoes traversed the Red Sea since Jan. 12, 2024.\n\nOIES said that after accounting for diversions, the re-routing of cargo via longer routes, and the consequent curtailment of LNG shipping capacity, global LNG supply could fall by 5.4 million tons year-on-year.\n\nIt noted that disruptions could primarily affect LNG deliveries to Europe from Qatar, and deliveries to Asia from the US, Russia, Algeria, and Egypt.\n\n\"Cargoes are being re-routed via the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) or diverted to other markets. The longer routes imply greater shipping costs and a smaller volume of LNG that can be delivered by each vessel over a given period of time,\" it said.\n\nAs a result, these increased operational costs represent an 'inter-basin LNG shipping premium' that will be borne by the exporters.\n\nAccording to OIES, these additional costs will only be recouped through higher sales prices if disruptions cause a rise in LNG import prices in Europe and Asia.\n\nDue to an unprecedented drought that has lowered the water level, the Panama Canal put restrictions in place for the transit of ships in 2023. -",

    "title": "Al Hassan Ghazi Ibrahim Shaker Co. delivers exceptional FY23 performance",
    "body": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Al Hassan Ghazi Ibrahim Shaker Co. (\"Shaker\", the \"Group\" or the \"Company\"), Saudi Arabia's leading importer, manufacturer, and distributor of Air Conditioners and Home Appliances, announced its financial results for the full year 2023, cementing its position as a market leader through exceptional financial results and transformative strategic initiatives.\n\nFinancial Highlights:\n\nRevenue reached SAR 1.24 billion in FY23, up 19.19% YoY and highest since FY16, driven by double digit growth in the HVAC Solutions and Home Appliances segment of 18.11% and 21.19% respectively. Gross profit of SAR 317.76 million in FY23, up 33.71% YoY, driven by higher sales, an optimized sales strategy combining diversified product and channel portfolio, and efficient management of cost of goods sold (COGS). Operating profit of SAR 89.15 million in FY23, up 110.48% YoY, driven by higher revenues and improved gross margins, supported by lower impairment loss on trade and other receivables. Net profit of SAR 65.43 million in FY23, up 99.28% YoY and highest since FY15, driven by higher revenue and operating profit, along with a 51.86% increase in share of profit from LG-Shaker HVAC factory and lower zakat and tax. EPS of SAR 1.36 in FY23, an increase of 99.28 % YoY. Q4-FY23 revenue of SAR 259.56 million (Q4-FY22: SAR 209.49 million) and net profit of SAR 3.80 million (Q4-FY22: net loss of SAR 2.36 million)\n\nIn FY23, Shaker generated the highest revenue since FY16 and highest net profit since FY15, signifying a year of significant growth and strategic execution. The commitment to achieving growth while strengthening its financial health was demonstrated with continued deleveraging as net debt reduced by 20.95%. Further improvements in inventory management and working capital led to strong cash generation from operations of SAR 20.82 million.\n\nShaker reinforced its market leadership, by focusing on growth in core business segments. A landmark agreement with LG expanded Shaker's portfolio to include the full range of LG products in its Home Appliances and Entertainment offering. This expanded Shaker's addressable market share, fueling further expansion and momentum in the Home Appliances segment.\n\nAdditionally, Shaker's strategic divestment of New Vision for Electronics and Electrical Appliances in Jordan streamlined operations and allocated resources more effectively by using the sales proceeds to reduce loans, thereby enhancing its market competitiveness and financial stability.\n\nShaker's investment in digitalization is playing an important role in enhancing operational efficiency. The Company's current transition to SAP's S/4HANNA ERP system is a significant move towards integrating efficient business functions and enabling informed data-driven decision making across the organization. Implementation began in Q3-FY23 and full roll-out is expected in FY24.\n\nDuring the second half of the year, Shaker delivered on its B2C retail expansion strategy, opening its 7th physical store aimed at redefining the shopping experience to be more innovative and engaging for a newer generation of customers. Another 2 stores are set to open in FY24, signaling continued expansion of the physical footprint and commitment to provide unparalleled service to its customers. This complements Shaker's commitment to expand its e-commerce offerings, catering to a wider audience with accessible, convenient, and diverse shopping options.\n\nThe acquisition of a 10% stake in Cashew, a digital BNPL (buy-now, pay-later) platform will enable Shaker to tap into new growth opportunities in the Kingdom's fintech retail sector and digital lending space while diversifying its business model into complementary verticals.\n\nBuilding on the successes of 2023, the issuance of bonus shares in December highlighted Shaker's focus on creating and returning value to its shareholders. Looking ahead, Shaker remains committed to its strategic imperatives: focusing on core business for sustained growth, expanding retail presence to meet evolving consumer demands, enhancing e-commerce capabilities to harness digital growth opportunities, and championing the Saudi Made initiative as part of its contribution to domestic industrial advancement. A new strategic vision is expected to be unveiled by mid-2024, which will guide Shaker into its next phase of growth.\n\nMr. Mohammed Ibrahim Abunayyan, CEO at Shaker, said:\n\n\"2023 was a remarkable year for us, characterized by strong financial performance and strategic advancements as we achieved our highest revenue since FY16 and net profit since FY15. It is a testament to the execution of our growth strategy, focused on building an agile, dynamic, and high-growth business environment, positioning Shaker as the number one destination for all things home in the Kingdom. Our commitment to strengthening our core business has yielded sustainable long-term gains. The steady growth in our B2B portfolio has enhanced the stability of HVAC Solutions by securing larger contracts and long-term engagements. At the same time, the successful integration of LG's comprehensive product range, our well-established portfolio offering from Midea and Ariston, along with Shaker's targeted marketing efforts led to unlocking additional growth potential within the Home Appliances segment.\n\nBeyond financials, we remain steadfast in our commitment to the Made in Saudi initiative, boosting local production capacities, fostering self-reliance, and aligning with the Kingdom's Vision 2030 aspirations. Looking ahead, we are excited about the future, with plans to unveil a new strategic vision in 2024 that will guide us into our next phase of growth.\"\n\nAbout Shaker\n\nShaker was founded in 1950 and was amongst the first in Saudi Arabia to introduce Air Conditioning & Home Appliances for Saudi consumers.

    "body": "MAYBANK initiated coverage on Thomson Medical with \"buy\" and a target price of S$0.08.\n\nThe move came amid optimism over the healthcare provider's long-term growth plans, given its strategic presence in Malaysia and recent acquisition of FV Hospitals in Vietnam.\n\nThe target price of S$0.08 implies a potential upside of 50.9 per cent from the counter's last trading price of S$0.053 as at the midday trading break on Wednesday (Feb 28). Shares of Thomson Medical were up 1.9 per cent or S$0.001 at the time.\n\nIt is pegged to an FY2025 enterprise value that is 23 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, which is 0.5 standard deviation below Thomson Medical's historical mean.\n\n\"While trading at a premium to peers, we think this is justifiable given its strong portfolio of healthcare assets in the region, which offers high growth potential,\" analyst Eric Ong said in the Tuesday report.\n\nMost recently, the mainboard-listed group expanded to Vietnam by acquiring FV Hospital for nine trillion dong (S$494.2 million). As part of the deal, the group acquired Far East Medical Vietnam, which includes FV Hospital and a network of primary and specialist clinics.\n\n\"This paves the way for further inroads into one of South-east Asia's fastest-growing healthcare markets, including the huge potential for medical tourism in the country,\" said Ong.\n\nIn Johor, Malaysia, the group owns 9.2 hectares of waterfront land in Iskandar Malaysia and Johor Bahru's city centre, which \"holds immense potential\" for monetisation.\n\nIt also owns Thomson Iskandar Medical Hub, a 500-bed tertiary hospital which could stand to benefit from the establishment of the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone when completed within the next few years.\n\nIn Singapore, the group is looking to maximise its hospital bed capacity in anticipation of a rise in baby deliveries in the Year of the Dragon.\n\nMaybank noted that Thomson Medical Centre delivers around 25 per cent of Singapore's babies annually and has some 40 to 50 per cent in market share of live birth deliveries in the private sector.",

    "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 28 -- Malaysia's export unit value index slipped by 0.5 per cent to 147.2 points in January 2024 from 148.0 points in the previous month, said the Department of Statistics (DoSM).\n\nChief statistician Datuk Seri Mohd Uzir Mahidin said the drop in the export unit value index was led by the decrease in the index of mineral fuels (-2.8 per cent) and manufactured goods (-0.2 per cent), as well as machinery and transport equipment (-0.2 per cent).\n\n\"However, the export volume index went up by 4.0 per cent in line with the increase in the index of mineral fuels (+30.4 per cent), manufactured goods (+9.6 per cent) and chemicals (+2.4 per cent),\" he said in a statement today.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted export volume index grew by 16.1 per cent to 163.5 points from 140.8 points previously, he said.\n\nOn an annual comparison, the unit value index and volume index increased by 3.1 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Mohd Uzir said the import unit value index decreased by 0.1 per cent to 128.5 points from 128.7 points previously, contributed by the decline in the index of mineral fuels (-2.6 per cent), inedible crude materials (-0.3 per cent) and manufactured goods (-0.2 per cent).\n\nThe import volume index grew by 5.6 per cent in January 2024 as compared to the previous month, attributed to the increment in the index of food (+20.8 per cent), manufactured goods (+13.6 per cent) and mineral fuels (+6.0 per cent).\n\n\"The seasonally adjusted import volume index edged up by 9.8 per cent to 208.4 points from 189.8 points.\n\n\"The year-on-year comparison showed that the import unit value index and volume index rose by 0.4 per cent and 18.5 per cent, respectively,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, Malaysia's terms of trade dropped by 0.4 per cent month-on-month to 114.5 points in January 2024, driven by the decrease in the index of animal and vegetable oils and fats (-1.3 per cent), machinery and transport equipment (-0.4 per cent) and mineral fuels (-0.2 per cent).\n\nThe terms of trade grew by 2.7 per cent year-on-year in January 2024 from 111.5 points in the same month last year. -- Bernama",

    "body": "India will become a manufacturing powerhouse, and the government has made aggressive plans to realise that vision, said a top executive of the US multinational Cisco Systems.\n\n\"India is poised to become a manufacturing powerhouse. The government has made aggressive plans,\" Daisy Chittilapilly, president, Cisco India & Saarc, said at the fifth edition of the India Inc on the Move (IIoTM), organised by the Economic Times Business Verticals together with Rockwell Automation in Chennai on Tuesday.\n\n\"Industry 4.0 adoption can help the manufacturing sector contribute to 25% of the GDP by FY2026,\" she added. India, according to her, is becoming the fastest growing mobile manufacturer worldwide.\n\nCisco has already announced plans to start manufacturing at the outskirts of Chennai, and that would be operational by the second-half of this year, Chittilapilly said.\n\n\"Technology will be a game-changer for Indian industries. Smart manufacturing technology boosts productivity by 10-15%. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven predictive maintenance can slash downtime by 50%,\" she said.\n\nIn four manufacturers three use digital tools to improve supply chain transparency, according to the top executive. Transformation in manufacturing could boost direct job creation by 1million to 4 million annually, Chittilapilly said. Manufacturing in a digital-first-world includes technology, talent and execution. They are the strategic drivers, Chittilapilly said.\n\nShe said that future-proofing India's factories is essential and some of the emerging trends include usage of generative AI in research and development (R&D) activities, industrial metaverse, predictive maintenance and digital twin technologies.\n\nIn addition, scalable storage, automated and predictive security and self-healing networks are the other areas of smart manufacturing that are seeing adoption, the executive added.\n\nThe Chuck Robbins-headed company offers advanced manufacturing operations, workforce enablement and industrial security solutions across sectors, and provides end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT)-based solutions including industrial sensors.\n\nThe American multinational that offers software products for smart factories said that AppD real-time performance monitoring solution, Webex tool, full-stack observability, and routing and wireless can boost end-to-end operations and security as well as optimise efficiency and improve uptime.\n\nThe day-long IIoTM conference brought together more than 1,000 delegates from multiple companies from across the country.",

He has also said that the two governments will continue to jointly promote substantive cooperation projects aimed at enhancing the welfare of both their peoples. Furthermore, he has pledged that Tuvalu will remain committed to firmly backing Taiwan's efforts to expand its international participation.\n\nTuvalu successfully completed democratic parliamentary elections on January 26. The results of the vote drew much attention from both the Taiwanese and international media.

All parties continue to communicate with the related ministries and as far as we know the process is nearing completion,\" CEO Patrick Walujo said in an online briefing.\n\nIndonesian minister for small and medium enterprises Teten Masduki said last week TikTok had yet to comply with the regulation.\n\nTikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Following December's deal, TikTok has reopened its e-commerce services, which are now facilitated by Tokopedia.\n\nGoTo's management said in the briefing that it will receive a quarterly e-commerce fee from Tokopedia, with the sum being dependent on Tokopedia's gross merchandise value.\n\nBased on a GMV of $2.9 billion recorded in the third quarter of last year, the e-commerce service fee for GoTo will be $11.4 million, GoTo said.\n\nGoTo also expects its partnership with TikTok will benefit not only its e-commerce business but also its financial services segment as it will be able to offer digital payments and \"buy now, pay later\" credit schemes on TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stefanno Sulaiman and Stanley Widianto; Editing by Kanupriya Kapoor and Muralikumar Anantharaman)",

    "title": "Why does the US government think a Kroger-Albertsons merger would be bad for grocery shoppers?",
    "body": "Kroger and Albertsons -- two of the biggest grocery chains in the United States -- had hoped to complete the largest supermarket merger in the country's history this year. But their plan to compete with big-box retailers by combining forces faces legal challenges that make it look far less likely, at least any time soon.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against Kroger's $24.6 billion deal to acquire Albertsons and a federal lawsuit that asks a judge to block the merger for now. Attorneys general from eight states and the District of Columbia joined the lawsuit lodged in Oregon.\n\nHere's what to know about the proposed merger, what it might mean for shoppers -- and why the U.S. government opposes it.\n\nMost Americans have filled a basket at an Albertsons or a Kroger store even if the sign out front had a different name. Kroger, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, operates 2,750 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The company's 19 brands include Ralphs, Smith's, King Soopers, Fred Meyer, Food 4 Less, Mariano's, Pick 'n Save and Harris Teeter. Albertsons, based in Boise, Idaho, operates 2,273 stores in 34 states. Its 15 brands include Safeway, Jewel Osco, Vons, Acme and Shaw's. Together, Kroger and Albertsons employ around 700,000 people.\n\nCities where Kroger-owned and Albertsons-owned stores now vie for customers include Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago and the District of Columbia.\n\nSome labor unions and consumer advocacy groups predict the merger would result in store closures, leaving communities with fewer grocery options and giving Kroger-Albertsons fewer incentives to keep prices down.\n\n\"A merger of Kroger and Albertsons would dramatically decrease competition within an already consolidated food retail market, which would result in fewer grocery stores and higher food prices, with predictable adverse consequences for food and nutrition security for consumers across the country,\" Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said in a statement applauding the FTC's action.\n\nKroger says no stores would close as a result of the merger. It also promises to invest $1.3 billion to update Albertsons' existing outlets. But in some places, stores would get sold to a new owner. To stave off monopoly concerns from federal regulators, Kroger and Albertsons agreed to sell 413 stores and eight distribution centers in locations where their operations overlap.\n\nThe buyer would be C&S Wholesale Grocers, a grocery supplier that also owns the Piggly Wiggly brand. But the FTC says the divestiture deal is \"inadequate\" and the proposal doesn't contain enough stores or other resources to replicate the competition that currently exists between Albertsons and Kroger.\n\nKroger and Albertsons agreed to merge in October 2022. The companies said a merger would help them better compete with big retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, because they would have more power to negotiate prices and could save on distribution and administrative costs. Together, they would control around 13% of the U.S. grocery market; Walmart now controls 22%, while Costco controls 6%, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman.\n\nThe FTC says the deal would eliminate the competition that now exists between Kroger and Albertsons, and without competition, buyers would see higher prices, lower quality and fewer shopping choices. In a separate lawsuit filed earlier this month, Colorado's attorney general gave a specific example. The city of Gunnison, Colorado, has two groceries: Kroger-owned City Market and Albertsons-owned Safeway. The merger would make Kroger the only chain operating in this area, and a Gunnison resident would have to drive 65 miles to a non-Kroger store.\n\nConsumers also would see fewer deals if the stores merged since Kroger and Albertsons currently use promotions to lure shoppers away from the competition, according to the FTC. The agency also foresees less incentive for stores to add or improve services. When Albertsons executives saw unstaffed deli counters at Kroger's Fred Meyer stores, for example, they added counter staff at their stores. In the same way, Kroger improved its grocery pickup services in some markets to compete with Albertsons.\n\nThe FTC says competition at supermarket pharmacy counters also benefits consumers. When Kroger went out-of-network with a major pharmacy benefits administrator last year, for example, Albertsons offered consumers a $75 grocery coupon to transfer their prescriptions.\n\nKroger says it wouldn't, and that it would invest $500 million to lower prices across its stores once the deal goes into effect. GlobalData, a market research firm, said discount chains like Aldi and cost-conscious competitors like Walmart would help keep prices in check even if Kroger and Albertsons combined.\n\nBut the FTC isn't convinced. In a 2012 study, FTC economists found that prices increased more than 2% when grocers merged in places where they had little competition. Prices only decreased or stayed the same in markets where grocers had more competitors.\n\nKroger promised to boost wages and benefits by $1 billion if the deal goes through. C&S Wholesale Grocers said it would honor all collective bargaining agreements with Kroger and Albertsons workers if it takes over QFC, Mariano's, Carrs and other stores.\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents most workers at both companies, voted last year to oppose the merger, saying the companies hadn't been transparent about how it would impact workers. Not all workers are opposed to the deal, however. UFCW Local 555, which represents grocery workers in Oregon and Idaho, said earlier this month that it supports the Kroger and Albertsons merger because it trusts C&S to operate the stores in its area.\n\nThe attorneys general of Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Wyoming and the District of Columbia filed the federal lawsuit along with the FTC. The attorneys general of Colorado and Washington previously filed their own lawsuits seeking to block the merger.\n\nKroger and Albertsons can file a response to the FTC's administrative complaint within 14 days. A hearing has been set for July 31. While the case winds its way through the agency's legal process, the FTC wants a federal judge to issue a temporary injunction barring the merger. Kroger and Albertsons have said they will appeal any adverse rulings.",

Please also refer to the Definitions section and the notes of this Interim Report for more information.\n\n\"I am proud of our achievements in 2023. While navigating a challenging market, we successfully delivered solid top line and Adjusted EBITDA growth and created further value for all our stakeholders. The integration and consolidation of past acquisitions allowed us to improve margins and drive substantial cost savings, while we also strengthened our balance sheet through the strategic sale of our social cards portfolio. Through these initiatives, we have continued to build the technological, financial and operational foundations to scale our business further in the coming years.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, we see momentum building up in our business, with both demand and publisher partners showing real potential for accelerating our growth through Azerion's digital advertising platform. The ongoing consolidation of the European market also offers exciting opportunities to expand our business, leveraging the scale benefits associated with our advertising platform, both through organic market share gains as well as via potential partnerships and acquisitions.\"\n\nNet revenue for the quarter amounted to € 171.8 million compared to € 148.8 million in Q4 2022, an increase of approximately 15.5%. The increase in Net Revenue year on year came mainly from growth in the Platform segment of approximately € 33.1 million, driven largely by advertising revenue from Direct sales and the integration of previous acquisitions, offset by a reduction in Net Revenue in Premium Games due to the sale of the social card games portfolio completed during Q3 2023, with that portfolio contributing Net revenue of € 10.2 million in Q4 2022.\n\nNet revenue FY 2023 amounted to € 515.0 million compared to € 452.6 million in FY 2022, an increase of approximately 13.8%, mainly due to Net revenue growth in the Platform segment between the same periods of approximately € 73.9 million, particularly in advertising revenue from Direct sales and from the integration of previous acquisitions.\n\nEarnings\n\nThe operating profit for the quarter amounted to € 6.8 million, compared to an operating profit of € 8.8 million in Q4 2022, with the reduction mainly explained by the loss of earnings due to the sale of the social card games portfolio completed on 28 August 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was € 25.9 million for the quarter compared to € 22.1 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 17.2% due to increased Net revenue from the Platform segment at higher margins driven by increased contribution to advertising revenue from Direct sales, continued integration of previous acquisitions and ongoing cost optimisation, partly offset by the loss of earnings due to the sale of the social card games portfolio.\n\nThe operating profit for FY 2023 amounted to € 73.5 million, compared to a loss of € (139.0) million for FY 2022 mainly explained by the gain on the sale of the social card games portfolio completed on 28 August 2023 of € 72.6 million and the € 144.5 million of De-SPAC related expenses incurred in 2022, but not present in 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was € 71.4 million for FY 2023 compared to € 52.1 million for FY 2022, an increase of 37.0%, mainly due to increased contribution to advertising revenue from Direct sales, continued integration of previous acquisitions and ongoing cost optimisation, partly offset by the loss of earnings due to the sale of the social card games portfolio.\n\nCash flow\n\nCash flow from operating activities in Q4 2023 was an inflow of approximately € 35.5 million, mainly due to movements in net working capital, reflecting an increase in trade and other payables of € 30.4 million and increase in trade and other receivables of € (6.5) million. Cash flow from investing activities for the period was an outflow of € (19.5) million, mainly due to cash outflow on past acquisitions of subsidiaries including Hawk in the amount of € (15.7) million and payments for intangibles of € (3.7) million. Cash flow from financing activities in the period amounted to an outflow of € (45.4) million, mainly relating to bond refinancing.\n\nCash flow from operating activities for FY 2023 was an inflow of € 54.4 million, mainly due to movements in net working capital, reflecting a decrease in trade and other receivables of € 12.1 million and increase in trade and other payables € 20.2 million. Cash flow from investing activities was an outflow of € (10.2) million, mainly due to deferred payments and earn-outs relating to past acquisitions including Hawk of € (48.8) million and payments for intangibles of € (23.3) million, offset in part by € 66.0 million of proceeds from the sale of the social card games portfolio. Cash flow from financing activities totalled an outflow of € (55.4) million, mainly relating to the bond refinancing.\n\nCapex\n\nAzerion capitalises development costs related to internal development of assets, a core activity to support innovation in its platform. These costs primarily relate to developers' time devoted to the development of the platform, games and other new features. In Q4 2023 Azerion capitalised € 3.4 million, equivalent to 12.4% (2022: 15.8%) of gross personnel costs excluding restructuring provision expense. For FY 2023 Azerion capitalised € 17.5 million, equivalent to 16.2% (2022: 16.3%) of gross personnel costs excluding restructuring provision expense.\n\nFinancial position and borrowing\n\nNet interest bearing debt amounted to € 145.1 million as at 31 December 2023, mainly comprising the outstanding bond loan with a nominal value of € 165 million (part of a total € 300 million framework) and lease liabilities with a balance of € 14.3 million less the cash and cash equivalents position of € 39.9 million. The Net interest bearing debt position as at 31 December 2023 implies a Net interest bearing debt / Adjusted EBITDA ratio as at 31 December 2023 of approximately 2x and a YoY reduction in Net Interest Bearing Debt of 18.3% compared to € 177.6 million as at 31 December 2022.\n\nAs defined in the Terms & Conditions of the Senior Secured Callable Floating Rate Bonds ISIN: NO0013017657. Please also refer to the Definitions section and the notes of this Interim Report for more information.\n\nPlatform Segment\n\nOur Platform segment includes our digital advertising activities, e-commerce, the operation and distribution of casual games and Fanzone. It generates Net revenue mainly by displaying digital advertisements in both game and general content, as well as selling and distributing AAA games through our e-commerce channels. Advertisers are serviced through two models: i) Direct sales, which involve a direct engagement between Azerion's commercial teams and advertisers or their agencies in the placement of digital advertisements, and ii) Automated auction sales in which advertising inventory is purchased through the open market. Platform is also integrated with parts of our Premium Games segment, leveraging inter-segment synergies.\n\nNet revenue of € 157.8 million in Q4 2023, compared to € 124.7 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 26.5%, driven mainly by increased contribution from Direct sales, sales opportunities created through the integration of past acquisitions and global sales teams, combined with additional revenue from Hawk and increased sales of game keys from our e-commerce platform. In Q4 2023, Azerion's Direct sales teams contributed approximately 75% of Platform advertising Net revenue, as compared to approximately 65% in Q4 2022, with the balance provided by Automated auction sales. In Q4 2023, our e-commerce business generated Net revenue of € 31.7 million as compared to € 22.1 million in Q4 2022, an increase of approximately 43.4% YoY, largely driven by an increase in the number of AAA publisher partners and popular title releases. In Q4 2023, our e-commerce Net revenue represented approximately 20.1% of total Platform Net revenue, as compared to approximately 17.7% in Q4 2022.\n\nNet revenue of € 437.4 million for FY 2023 , compared to € 363.5 million for FY 2022, an increase of 20.3%, driven mainly by increased contribution from Direct sales, integration of past acquisitions and global sales teams, combined with the roll out of new ad formats on the Platform throughout the year, the addition of Hawk and increased sales of game keys by the e-commerce platform in the fourth quarter. For the FY 2023, Advertising revenue contributed around 80% of Platform segment Net Revenue, with the e-commerce business representing the remaining balance. For FY 2023, Azerion's Direct sales teams contributed approximately 70% of Platform advertising Net revenue, as compared to approximately 60% for FY 2022, with the balance provided by Automated auction sales. For the full-year 2023, our e-commerce business generated Net Revenue of € 88.8 million as compared to € 68.3 million for FY 2022, an increase of approximately 30.0% YoY, largely driven by an increase in the number of AAA publisher partners and popular title releases. In FY 2023, our e-commerce Net revenue represented approximately 20.3% of total Platform Net revenue, as compared to approximately 18.8% in Q4 2022.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of € 22.3 million in Q4 2023, compared to € 17.7 million in Q4 2022, an increase of 26.0% due to growth in higher margin Direct sales, improved spend on higher-impact ads in channels such as audio, CTV and DOOH, increased monetisation of exclusive partnerships and owned and operated content, together with ongoing consolidation and integration of previously acquired businesses and cost optimisation. These effects were partly offset by the integration of lower margin revenue from Hawk, which operates a managed and self-service DSP for advertiser campaigns, whilst our e-commerce platforms saw a seasonal increase in revenue during Thanksgiving and Christmas promotions.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of € 52.7 million for FY 2023, compared to € 34.8 million for FY 2022, an increase of more than 51.4%, mainly as a result of higher Direct sales and ongoing consolidation and integration of previously acquired businesses and cost optimisation.\n\nThe Average Digital Ads Sold per Month increased to 12.9 billion from 10.7 billion in Q4 2022, reflecting the growth of the Platform business through increased ad format offerings and the integration of previous acquisitions. As of Q1 2023 the reported number of average digital ads sold per month include the following previous acquisitions: Adplay, Adverline, Madvertise, Hybrid Theory, MMedia, Takerate, Targetspot and Vlyby.\n\nThe Average Gross Revenue per Million Processed Ad Requests was € 39.5 in Q4 2023, compared to € 32.8 in Q4 2022, demonstrating our ability to grow and manage the advertising auction platform efficiently and profitably whilst providing an attractive proposition for advertisers and publishers. New ad formats integrated into the platform have also contributed to higher margins.\n\nAdditional new ad formats have been included as of Q1 2023, these include Adplay, Adverline, Madvertise, Hybrid Theory, MMedia, Takerate, Targetspot and Vlyby. The non-financial performance of the recent Hawk acquisition is not included in the table above.\n\nPremium Games Segment\n\nAs of Q4 2023, the Premium Games segment consists of social casino games and metaverse games. Azerion completed the sale of its social card games portfolio to Playtika Holding Corp. on 28 August 2023 and its contribution to the Premium Games segment ceased at that date. The segment generates revenue mainly by offering users the ability to make in-game purchases for extra features and virtual goods to enhance their gameplay experience. This segment aims to stimulate social interaction among players and build communities, offering an extended value proposition to advertisers and generating cross-selling opportunities with the Platform segment.\n\nThe operating profit of Premium Games and social card games portfolio includes the net gain from the sale of the social card games portfolio for € 72.6 million.\n\nNet revenue of € 14.0 million in Q4 2023, as compared to € 24.1 million in Q4 2022, a decrease of (41.9)%, mainly due to the revenue loss from the sale of our social card games portfolio. The Net revenue of the remaining Premium Games titles across our social casino and metaverse portfolios showed a small increase in Q4 2023 at € 14.0 million, compared to € 13.9 million in Q4 2022.\n\nNet revenue of € 77.6 million for FY 2023, compared to € 89.1 million for FY 2022, a decrease of (12.9)% predominantly due to the loss of revenue from the sale of our social card games portfolio. On a like-for-like basis, the Net revenue of our social casino and metaverse portfolios was approximately € 49.3 million compared to € 52.0 million for the full year 2022, a decrease of approximately (5.2)%, mainly driven by lower revenue in our metaverse environments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of € 3.6 million in Q4 2023, compared to € 4.4 million in Q4 2022, a decrease of (18.2)%, mainly due to the loss of contribution following the sale of the social card games portfolio. The Adjusted EBITDA of the remaining Premium Games titles across our social casino and metaverse portfolios doubled from € 1.8 million in Q4 2022 to € 3.6 million in Q4 2023, driven by improved performance in the social casino portfolio and revenue growth from Habbo Hotel due to improved engagement with previous higher spending users and cost optimisation across the segment.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of € 18.7 million for FY 2023, compared to € 17.3 million for FY 2022, an increase of 8.1% mainly due to improved performance in both the social cards and social casino portfolios and cost optimisation across the segment combined with improved profitability in metaverse titles, more than offsetting the contribution lost in Q4 2023 from the sale of our social card games portfolio in Q3 2023. On a like-for-like basis, the Adjusted EBITDA of the remaining Premium Games titles across our social casino and metaverse portfolios was € 9.0 million for FY 2023, as compared to € 5.6 million for FY 2022, an increase of approximately 60.7% mainly driven by improved performance in the social casino portfolio and cost optimisation across the segment.\n\nAs from 28 August 2023, the selected operational KPIs no longer contain results from the social card games portfolio following its divestment.\n\nOutlook\n\nNet revenue for FY 2024 is expected to be in the range of approximately € 540 million to € 560 million, with annual growth thereafter in the medium term expected to be approximately 10%.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for FY 2024 is expected to be in the range of approximately € 75 million to € 80 million, with annual Adjusted EBITDA margin thereafter in the medium term expected to be in the range of approximately 14% to 16%.\n\nReferences to bond terms in the table above refer to the terms as defined in the Senior Secured Callable Floating Rate Bonds ISIN: NO0013017657\n\nReconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA\n\nReconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA - Q4\n\nin millions of €\n\nReconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA - FY\n\nin millions of €\n\nOther mainly includes the net gain from the sale of the social card games portfolio for € 72.6 million.\n\nIn relation to ongoing consolidation and integration, restructuring charges in Q1 and Q2 2024 are expected in total to be in the range of approximately € 1.0 million to € 1.5 million.

All statements other than statements of historical facts are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Azerion to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. Words and expressions such as aims, ambition, anticipates, believes, could, estimates, expects, goals, intends, may, milestones, objectives, outlook, plans, projects, risks, schedules, seeks, should, target, will or other similar words or expressions are typically used to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause the actual results, performance or events to differ materially from future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this communication. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\n\nAny forward-looking statements reflect Azerion's current views and assumptions based on information currently available to Azerion's management. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and Azerion does not assume any obligation to update or revise such statements as a result of new information, future events or other information, except as required by law.\n\nThe interim financial results of Azerion Group N.V. as included in this communication are required to be disclosed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Senior Secured Callable Floating Rate Bonds ISIN: NO0013017657.\n\nThis report has not been reviewed or audited by Azerion's external auditor.\n\nCertain financial data included in this communication consist of alternative performance measures (\"non-IFRS financial measures\"), including Adjusted EBITDA. The non-IFRS financial measures, along with comparable IFRS measures, are used by Azerion's management to evaluate the business performance and are useful to investors. They may not be comparable to similarly titled measures as presented by other companies, nor should they be considered as an alternative to the historical financial results or other indicators of Azerion Group N.V.'s cash flow based on IFRS. Even though the non-IFRS financial measures are used by management to assess Azerion Group N.V.'s financial position, financial results and liquidity and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and the recipients should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Azerion Group N.V.'s financial position or results of operations as reported under IFRS.\n\nFor all definitions and reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures please also refer to www.azerion.com/investors.\n\nThis report may contain forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures to the most comparable IFRS financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-IFRS financial measures to the most comparable IFRS financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Azerion. Moreover, estimating such IFRS financial measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-IFRS financial measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable IFRS financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Azerion Group N.V.'s consolidated financial statements.\n\nThis communication does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities or any other financial instruments.\n\nContact\n\nInvestor Relations: ir@azerion.comMedia relations: press@azerion.com",

    "body": "About 4,000 families squatting on the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) railway line that blocks the train movements on the Cape Town central line are still waiting to be moved. So far, about 2,000 families have been moved from Langa, Nyanga and Philippi in what was called Operation Bhekela.\n\nIt was an attempt to move the rail line occupiers about 10 metres away from the rail tracks in an attempt to resume train services.\n\nBut, thousands of others remain.\n\nCape Town Central was one of the busiest and most profitable of the metro railway lines. It remains in ruins filled with litter and people who were never supposed to be there in the first place.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, shacks were built on the rail reserve and railway lines in Langa, Nyanga, and Philippi. This led to theft and vandalism of infrastructure.\n\nPrasa appears to struggle to clear and return the service to its former glory. Some occupiers say promises and concessions have been made during community engagements.\n\n\"As the committee has said, they were promised within 18 months that they are going to be relocated to the right land. But they are still waiting as they have already demanded some basic services to Prasa, that we are hoping Prasa will provide those services,\" says of the occupiers.\n\nWard 8 Counsellor from Philippi, Lindikaya Payiya, says about 891 families in Philippi have been moved from the railway line to a piece of land behind Stock Road Transport Interchange since last year.\n\nPayiya says the occupation points to the chronic shortage of land and accommodation in the city.\n\n\"Prasa wants to fix the railway line so that the train can move while they are still trying to find land to relocate the people, because in Langa, they already moved the people on the railway line and the train is moving, but on this central line side we are still stuck.\"\n\nIt is about four years now since the land invasion, with several postponements on the dates for evictions. Some objections were that the infrastructure cannot accommodate that number of people.",

    "title": "Gold prices muted as rate fears keep traders to the sidelines By Investing.com",
    "body": "Investing.com-- Gold prices moved in a flat-to-low range on Wednesday, extending their recent run of muted performance as anxiety over higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates persisted ahead of key economic readings.\n\nThe yellow metal remained squarely within a $2,000 to $2,050 trading range established over the past month, as any upside in gold was largely limited by a string of Federal Reserve warnings that the bank was in no hurry to begin trimming rates early in 2024. Strength in the dollar, which remained near three-month highs, also pressured gold prices.\n\nStill, gold prices also remained firm above the key $2,000 an ounce support level, indicating that fears of a global economic slowdown and geopolitical tensions in Russia and the Middle East were feeding some safe haven demand for the yellow metal.\n\nSpot gold steadied at $2,030.69 an ounce, while gold futures expiring in April fell 0.2% to $2,039.45 an ounce by 00:20 ET (05:20 GMT).\n\nMarkets were now awaiting key inflation and economic growth readings for more trading cues.\n\nPCE price index data- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge- is due on Thursday, and is expected to show inflation remained sticky in January. Such a scenario gives the Fed more impetus to keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nSeveral Fed officials also warned this week that sticky inflation will keep the Fed from lowering interest rates early in 2024.\n\nBefore the inflation data, a second reading on fourth-quarter GDP is due later on Wednesday, and is expected to show some cooling in economic growth.\n\nBut the U.S. economy is still expected to remain well ahead of its developed world peers, giving the Fed enough headroom to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nHigher rates herald more pressure on gold, given that they increase the opportunity cost of buying bullion. Other precious metals also retreated on this notion, with platinum futures falling 0.5% to $892.05 an ounce, while silver futures fell 0.7% to $22.602 an ounce on Wednesday.\n\nAmong industrial metals, copper futures expiring in March fell 0.4% to $3.8390 a pound.\n\nThe red metal saw a strong run-up in recent weeks on optimism over more stimulus measures in top importer China.\n\nBut this rally will be tested on Friday with the release of closely-watched purchasing managers index data from the country, which is expected to provide more cues on the state of business activity through February.\n\nReadings for January showed little improvement in the economy.",

    "title": "Long-duration US Treasury ETFs: Are interest rates too high?",
    "body": "Is now the time to buy the iShares $ Treasury Bond 20+yr UCITS ETF (IDTL)?\n\nIDTL fell to a new low earlier this month after the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose a hotter-than-anticipated 0.3% and the Producer Price Index (PPI) also failed to meet expectations.\n\nIDTL, which is a highly liquid US government long bond ETF, was recently trading near the bottom of its 2024 trading range this year.\n\nAfter two negative years, IDTL returned 3.1% in 2023 amid rising investor optimism about inflation, potential US central bank interest rate cuts and the economy.\n\nBut with inflation's latest jump and the Fed's dovish turn on hold, buying IDTL on dips over the coming months could be an optimal approach to the product that tracks long-term US interest rates and has $7.2bn assets under management (AUM).\n\nInflation measured by the CPI, PPI, and PCE moved lower over the past months, causing bonds and IDTL to rally from the October 2023 16-year low.\n\nThe US central bank paused rate hikes over the past months as inflationary pressures receded, but although they have not lowered rates yet, they are likely to later in the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the January jump in CPI and PPI have caused long bond futures and IDTL to move to marginal new 2024 lows.\n\nWhile inflation is a critical factor for the path of least resistance of US rates over the coming months, geopolitics will also determine trends as the US remains the world's leading economy.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine and the potential for an escalating conflict in the Middle East could cause sudden flight-to-quality action in markets. Investors and traders worldwide consider US bonds and the US dollar safe havens in tumultuous times.\n\nHostilities could lead to sudden sharp rallies if worldwide hostilities increase or spread to other regions.\n\nThe uncertainty of the US presidential election and other issues could pull bond prices in opposite directions over the coming months, with the Fed striving to remain apolitical.\n\nWhile growing US debt at over $34trn could put pressure on the US credit rating and push bonds lower, the election and global unrest could also increase the safety profile of US government debt.\n\nBullish and bearish factors pulling bonds in opposite directions could limit any significant price moves outside the 2023 range.\n\nThe latest CPI data poured cold water over the recent stock market rally. As stocks falter, US government debt securities with guaranteed rates become more attractive investment vehicles. Rates are far higher than over the past years, causing some investors to shift capital from equities to fixed-income assets.\n\nHigher rates have caused capital to flow into IDTL in early 2024.\n\nTo be sure, the inflationary spiral is likely over. But the Fed's 2% target remains challenging. Rates are therefore likely to remain in a narrow range over the coming months. The recent move to a new low for 2024 could be a buying opportunity as capital flows toward fixed-income assets offer attractive yields.",

    "body": "ZIMBABWE is set to finance its 2024 total budget financing gap of ZWL$9,2 trillion through domestic and external borrowing, a development that will further sink the country deep into debt.\n\nAccording to the latest annual borrowing plan released by the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO), the total budget financing gap amounts to ZWL$9,2 trillion.\n\nIt comprises a budget deficit of ZWL$4,3 trillion (1,5% of gross domestic product) and amortisation of loans and maturing government securities estimated at ZWL$4,9 trillion.\n\nThe 2024 National Budget had projected revenues of ZWL$54 trillion against an estimated expenditures of ZWL$58 trillion.\n\n\"The gross financing gap will be financed through domestic and external borrowing as follows: Issuance of Treasury bills and bonds amounting to ZWL$5,8 trillion; disbursements from existing external loans amounting to ZWL$367 billion and new external loan disbursements amounting to ZWL$2,9 trillion,\" the report read.\n\nFurther borrowing will balloon Zimbabwe's debt, which is estimated at US$20 billion.\n\nHowever, the PDMO is optimistic that the uptake for medium to long-term government securities will increase given the projected stable macro-economic environment, characterised by low inflation and a stable exchange rate.\n\nThis comes as the macroeconomic environment is characterised by a sharp depreciation of the local currency and high inflation rate, with the International Monetary Fund indicating that the Zimbabwe dollar has lost about 95% of its buying power since December last year.\n\n\"Government securities, the baseline assumption is to issue Treasury bills and bonds through the auction system and private placements. From the existing external loans, projected disbursements amount to ZWL$366,6 billion (US$40,8 million),\" the report read in part.\n\n\"In 2024, new external loan disbursements for budget support and central government projects are projected at ZWL$2,9 trillion (US$330 million).\"\n\n\"The strategy is to gradually lengthen the maturities of government securities going forward. Uptake for medium to long-term government securities is expected to increase given the projected stable macroeconomic environment, characterised by low inflation and a stable exchange rate.\"\n\nThe report noted that the annual borrowing plan seeks to promote the growth of the domestic debt market by issuing Treasury bills and bonds while the government raises its financing requirements through the auction system to promote medium to long-term Treasury bonds and adherence to prescribed asset status.\n\n\"The strategy seeks to promote the development of the secondary market by issuing medium-to-long-term Treasury bonds and to enforce adherence to the prescribed asset status, for insurance companies and pension funds as required by law.\"\n\nThe report noted that the strategy in external financing is to prioritise concessional financing and to limit non-concessional borrowing to economically viable projects.\n\n\"The objectives of public debt management in Zimbabwe are provided for in Section 3 of the Public Debt Management Act (Chapter: 22:21) as: \"to ensure that government's needs and payment obligations are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long term, with a prudent level of risk, and to promote the development of the domestic debt market,\" the report read.\n\n\"The primary objective requires an assessment of cost and risk in relation to government borrowings and debt service. The secondary objective aims to support the development of an efficient and robust domestic debt market.\"",

    "title": "Zimbabwe treasury exposes abuse of sugar tax for profiteering",
    "body": "GOVERNMENT has condemned the abuse of the Beverages Sugar Content Tax and other tariff measures by some businesses that deliberately misinterpret clear policy propositions for profiteering while unjustifiably punishing innocent consumers.\n\nWhile consumption taxes are charged on the consumption of goods and services and are generally imposed at the time of the transaction, some businesses have gone overboard to disproportionately apply these taxes beyond their intended purpose, sparking an outcry from consumers.\n\nExamples include the recent obscene retail price increases of soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, and a range of value-added dilute juices. Others have gone to the extent of wrongly applying the tax on raw sugar.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube, said the application of the sugar tax, in particular, has been misconstrued by businesses, and expressed the Government's disdain for the recent price increases purportedly attributed to it.\n\nThe Government has already made a commitment to initially ring-fence the revenue generated from the Beverages Sugar Content Tax for therapy and procurement of cancer equipment for cancer diagnosis.\n\nAs a sign of such commitment, Prof Ncube, said Treasury will soon be commissioning the machines purchased therefrom, and that subsequent procurements will be advised accordingly.\n\nNotwithstanding the above positives, he said the Government was disturbed by the unjustifiable increase of prices for some beverages, which is unreasonably attributed to the impact of the Beverages Sugar Content Tax.\n\n\"Such behaviour by the responsible manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers is a dear demonstration of incorrect interpretation and, in some cases, profiteering.\n\n\"Government has, at its disposal, the prices charged by such operators prior to the introduction of the lax, the maximum impact of the Beverage Sugar Content Tax on the beverages in question and the expected prices thereof,\" said Prof Ncube.\n\n\"The Beverages Sugar Content Tax has been misconstrued as a levy on sugar, when it is applied differently. The tax is, rather, applied on the sugar content in beverages (drinks) specified in current legislation,\" the minister explained.\n\n\"Government wishes to categorically state that the tax does not apply to sugar in general, hence, should not be misinterpreted as affecting ordinary consumption. Producers of sugar, are, thus, not affected.\"\n\nSpecifically, Prof Ncube clarified that the sugar tax is applied to the \"added sugar\" in specified beverages, excluding natural sugar, to encourage responsible consumption of sugar contained therein.\n\n\"It is scientifically proven that excessive consumption of added sugar in beverages is linked to increased risk of non-communicable diseases,\" he said.\n\n\"The revision of the tax to 0090.001 per gram is dear testimony of the commitment by the Government to carefully consider and adopt constructive input from relevant stakeholders.\n\n\"Government is also aware that some producers cannot immediately reconfigure their production processes, whilst there is a commitment to reduce the sugar content by other manufacturers.\"\n\nOn the other hand, he urged consumers to also make the conscious choice to consume responsibly given the negative impact of excessive consumption of sugar on their health status.\n\n\"Government, in observance of the principles of transparency and accountability, takes this opportunity to enlighten the general public on the broad tax policy considerations that have traditionally guided the development of the taxation system, in particular, consumption-based taxes,\" said Prof Ncube.\n\nHe said it was disheartening that some businesses tend to frustrate progress at a time when the implementation of the National Development Strategy (NDS1) demands the recognition and adoption of bold and transformative measures to underpin the drive towards the attainment of our Vision 2030.\n\nOne of these measures includes the introduction of the Beverages Sugar Content Tax aimed at addressing quality of life and health matters through mobilising revenue that would be channelled towards such causes, he added.\n\n\"Government has recently noted with concern, the imposing nature of the input from some stakeholders on recently introduced tax measures, notwithstanding the distinct role between stakeholders and policymakers,\" said Prof Ncube.\n\nThe minister said the targeted tax instruments were critical across the globe and may be used to influence or re-direct such consumption, especially, where consumption is deemed or scientifically proven to impose negative externalities to society.\n\nHe further noted that the development and refinement of tax policy measures has always been a result of a consultative process involving business, consumer organisations, civil society, academia, Government agencies, and the general public, among others.\n\n\"Such consultations are in view of the fundamental roles of stakeholders to exercise the Constitutional right to influence public policy in a responsible manner, with a view to develop this great nation,\" said Prof Ncube.\n\n\"Government will continue to consult, as wide as possible, with relevant stakeholders, with a view to ensure enactment of evidence-based policies.\"\n\nHe also reiterated the Government's commitment to the implementation of measures targeted at the timely realisation of the NDS1 objectives, being conscious of President Mnangagwa's mantra: \"Nyika inovakwa nevene vayo/Ilizwe lakhiwa ngabanikazi balo\"",

    "body": "VMPL\n\nNew Delhi [India], February 28: 2024 is shaping up to be a monumental year for the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and DeFi 2.0 pioneer Retik Finance (RETIK) poised for significant developments and milestones. Let's delve into each of these digital assets and explore their potential trajectories in the coming year.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Halving Event\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, is gearing up for a significant event in 2024 - the Bitcoin halving. This event, scheduled to take place in April 2024, will see the number of generated BTC rewards per block reduced by 50 per cent, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The Bitcoin halving typically has several side effects, including potential price changes due to a decrease in the supply of newly created coins. For traders, this event can lead to fluctuations in BTC prices, while for miners, it means a 50 per cent lower block reward, which may affect the efficiency of mining operations. According to a recent report, Bitcoin is predicted to reach a new all-time high in 2024. Analysts forecast that BTC could soar to USD 88,000 (EUR82,000) throughout the year, before settling around USD 77,000 by the end of 2024. This bullish prediction comes as Bitcoin's current price hovers around USD 43,000, reflecting optimism among investors about its future trajectory.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Spot ETF Approval\n\nIn the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, anticipation is building around the potential approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2024. If approved, this ETF would mark the second time a cryptocurrency is listed on the New York exchange, following the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF earlier. Analysts believe that the odds are high for several Ethereum ETFs to be approved this year, based on a similar approval pattern as Bitcoin ETFs and the removal of Ethereum from the SEC's list of unregistered securities. The approval of the Ethereum ETF could have a profound impact on the market, with expectations of Ethereum reaching all-time highs of around USD 4,800 per ETH following the ETF's approval. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum may exhibit greater stability in its value, and the approval of the ETF is expected to generate renewed investor interest and wider adoption of the cryptocurrency across various financial sectors. Overall, the potential approval of the Ethereum ETF represents a milestone in the evolution of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial markets.\n\nDeFi 2.0 Pioneer Retik Finance (RETIK)\n\nEnter Retik Finance (RETIK), the DeFi 2.0 pioneer poised for a breakout year in 2024. In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralised finance (DeFi), Retik Finance (RETIK) emerges as a pioneering force, poised to revolutionise the DeFi space with its innovative ecosystem.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) has recently completed its presale stages, raising an impressive USD 32,050,000 from the sale of 400,000,000 RETIK tokens. Surpassing expectations, Retik Finance sold out its presale stages two months earlier than anticipated, demonstrating strong investor confidence and interest in its ecosystem. The platform's ecosystem, which includes a decentralised wallet, lending and borrowing protocols, and yields farming opportunities, is designed to empower users and drive the widespread adoption of decentralised financial services. With a total of 30,245 holders, Retik Finance (RETIK) is set to launch with a price set at USD 0.15 per token. Analysts predict that 2024 will be the year for Retik Finance, with potential gains soaring above 20,000 per cent. As the platform gears up for its official launch, Retik Finance will be sharing vital details about token listing and vesting schedules on its social media channels. Moreover, Retik Finance warns users to remain cautious of fake claims regarding RETIK tokens, emphasising the importance of verifying information from official sources. To celebrate the success of its presale, Retik Finance is offering a generous giveaway of USD 5000 to 25 lucky winners. This gesture underscores Retik Finance's commitment to its community and highlights the excitement surrounding its upcoming launch. With promising prospects and a strong foundation, Retik Finance is poised to make significant strides in the DeFi space and reshape the future of decentralised finance in 2024 and beyond.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by VMPL.

    "body": "Reigning champion Daniil Medvedev recorded a 6-3, 7-5 win over Alexander Shevchenko of Kazakhstan on Tuesday in the first round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships.\n\nMedvedev had withdrawn from two recent tournaments due to fatigue and a right foot injury, making this the top-seeded Russian's first on-court appearance since losing to Jannik Sinner in the Australian Open final.\n\nMedvedev advances to face Italian Lorenzo Sonego, who posted a 6-4, 5-7, 6-1 win over Sumit Nagal of India. The latter saved two break points at 5-5 in the second before running out of steam in the third set of the 2-hour, 19-minute match.\n\nFourth-seeded Karen Khachanov breezed to a 6-2, 6-3 win over Frenchman Luca Van Assche.\n\nFrance's Ugo Humbert, the fifth seed, posted a 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over countryman Gael Monfils and eighth-seeded Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain seized a 6-3, 4-6, 6-1 victory over Fabian Marozsan of Hungary.\n\nMovistar Chile Open\n\nItaly's Luciano Darderi emerged with a dramatic 7-6 (4), 6-7 (6), 7-6 (5) victory over Argentina's Facundo Bagnis in the first round at Santiago, Chile.\n\nIn a match that lasted 3 hours, 19 minutes, each player broke serve just once, both in the second set. Darderi failed to take advantage of two match points in the second-set tiebreaker.\n\nIn the third-set tiebreaker, Darderi jumped on top 5-2. Bagnis won the next three points to pull level before Darderi won the final two points.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Argentine qualifier Juan Manuel Cerundolo upset fifth-seeded Yannick Hanfmann of Germany 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. Eighth-seeded Jaume Munar blitzed Spanish countryman Bernabe Zapata Miralles 6-4, 6-1.\n\nIn an all-Chilean matchup, Tomas Barrios Vera defeated Cristian Garin 7-6 (3), 7-5.

Sixth-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway edged the United States' Christopher Eubanks 6-4, 6-7 (5), 6-3.

Whatever happened in the state Assembly in the last two-three days is a matter of concern,\" he said and added that he was compelled to speak on the functioning of the government as no post was important to him, but the relationship with the people of the state mattered to him.\n\nVikramaditya Singh said legislators had been sidelined, ignored and there were fiscal mismanagement.\n\nAll these issues were raised from time to time with the High Command in Delhi but they \"deliberately ignored the concerns.\"\n\n\"I was humiliated as a Cabinet Minister. They way they send messages to undermine me. There has to be due regard and respect for all in the Council of Ministers,\" he said.\n\n\"I am a disciplined member of the party, so I know where to draw the line,\" he said.\n\nThe fact, he said, was that the youth and dedicated party workers were hurt by the turn of events.",

    "title": "2024 Is The Year For Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) And Defi 2.0 Pioneer Retik Finance (RETIK)",
    "body": "VMPL\n\nNew Delhi [India], February 28: 2024 is shaping up to be a monumental year for the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and DeFi 2.0 pioneer Retik Finance (RETIK) poised for significant developments and milestones. Let's delve into each of these digital assets and explore their potential trajectories in the coming year.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) Halving Event\n\nBitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, is gearing up for a significant event in 2024 - the Bitcoin halving. This event, scheduled to take place in April 2024, will see the number of generated BTC rewards per block reduced by 50 per cent, from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. The Bitcoin halving typically has several side effects, including potential price changes due to a decrease in the supply of newly created coins. For traders, this event can lead to fluctuations in BTC prices, while for miners, it means a 50 per cent lower block reward, which may affect the efficiency of mining operations. According to a recent report, Bitcoin is predicted to reach a new all-time high in 2024. Analysts forecast that BTC could soar to USD 88,000 (EUR82,000) throughout the year, before settling around USD 77,000 by the end of 2024. This bullish prediction comes as Bitcoin's current price hovers around USD 43,000, reflecting optimism among investors about its future trajectory.\n\nEthereum (ETH) Spot ETF Approval\n\nIn the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, anticipation is building around the potential approval of the Ethereum Spot ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2024. If approved, this ETF would mark the second time a cryptocurrency is listed on the New York exchange, following the approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF earlier. Analysts believe that the odds are high for several Ethereum ETFs to be approved this year, based on a similar approval pattern as Bitcoin ETFs and the removal of Ethereum from the SEC's list of unregistered securities. The approval of the Ethereum ETF could have a profound impact on the market, with expectations of Ethereum reaching all-time highs of around USD 4,800 per ETH following the ETF's approval. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum may exhibit greater stability in its value, and the approval of the ETF is expected to generate renewed investor interest and wider adoption of the cryptocurrency across various financial sectors. Overall, the potential approval of the Ethereum ETF represents a milestone in the evolution of cryptocurrencies in traditional financial markets.\n\nDeFi 2.0 Pioneer Retik Finance (RETIK)\n\nEnter Retik Finance (RETIK), the DeFi 2.0 pioneer poised for a breakout year in 2024. In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralised finance (DeFi), Retik Finance (RETIK) emerges as a pioneering force, poised to revolutionise the DeFi space with its innovative ecosystem.\n\nRetik Finance (RETIK) has recently completed its presale stages, raising an impressive USD 32,050,000 from the sale of 400,000,000 RETIK tokens. Surpassing expectations, Retik Finance sold out its presale stages two months earlier than anticipated, demonstrating strong investor confidence and interest in its ecosystem. The platform's ecosystem, which includes a decentralised wallet, lending and borrowing protocols, and yields farming opportunities, is designed to empower users and drive the widespread adoption of decentralised financial services. With a total of 30,245 holders, Retik Finance (RETIK) is set to launch with a price set at USD 0.15 per token. Analysts predict that 2024 will be the year for Retik Finance, with potential gains soaring above 20,000 per cent. As the platform gears up for its official launch, Retik Finance will be sharing vital details about token listing and vesting schedules on its social media channels. Moreover, Retik Finance warns users to remain cautious of fake claims regarding RETIK tokens, emphasising the importance of verifying information from official sources. To celebrate the success of its presale, Retik Finance is offering a generous giveaway of USD 5000 to 25 lucky winners. This gesture underscores Retik Finance's commitment to its community and highlights the excitement surrounding its upcoming launch. With promising prospects and a strong foundation, Retik Finance is poised to make significant strides in the DeFi space and reshape the future of decentralised finance in 2024 and beyond.\n\nClick Here To Take Part In Retik Finance Presale\n\nVisit the links below for more information about Retik Finance (RETIK):\n\nWebsite: https://retik.com\n\nWhitepaper: https://retik.com/retik-whitepaper.pdf\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/retikfinance\n\n(ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by VMPL.

    "title": "Water levels in Zimbabwe dams decline",
    "body": "WATER levels in major dams have started declining as demand for irrigation water has been picking up with a significant number of farmers resorting to irrigation to sustain their summer crop.\n\nIn a statement, Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) head corporate communications and marketing, Mrs Marjorie Munyonga, said the decline was due to the current dry spell in the country.\n\nMrs Munyonga said they were observing and closely following the current weather patterns in the country, which were characterised by a prolonged dry spell and deteriorating water security situation for both domestic and agricultural purposes.\n\nShe said as at February 22, 2024, at least 35 percent more water had been released from the dams for irrigation than in a normal rainy season while the national dam level average had declined. \"Dam level averages for Mashonaland East, Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South and the Midlands are currently below the average expected during this time of the year in a normal season,\" she said.\n\n\"Declines in water levels due to increased releases for irrigation have been noted in dams such as Tugwi-Mukosi, Manyuchi, Mazvikadei, Sebakwe, Manyame, Chivero and Osborne. The proportion of cities, towns, growth points and rural service centres whose raw water sources hold sufficient water to last them for a period of at least 21 months now stands at 51. 1 percent with the proportion of centres whose water supply dams have water enough to last between 12 months and 20. 9 months currently at 38.3 percent.\n\n\"A proportion of 10. 9 percent of cities, towns, growth points and rural service centres are water insecure with their raw water supply dams holding water that can last them for less than 12 months. The proportion is expected to grow should the current drought conditions persist.\"\n\nMrs Munyonga said areas in that category included Chegutu, Mt Darwin, Figtree, Gwanda, Bulawayo and Mutoko.\n\nShe said the developments point to a very critical water security situation for the country during the year with very limited water available for socio-economic activities such as the upcoming winter cropping season and for domestic purposes.\n\n\"Under these circumstances the need for sustainable, efficient and sound management of the limited available water cannot be overemphasised,\" Mrs Munyonga said.\n\n\"ZINWA is therefore appealing to all individuals and entities intending to draw water from national dams for the winter cropping season to apply for or to renew their water abstraction agreements as required by the law. These water abstraction agreements make it possible for ZINWA to properly allocate the available water amongst the competing needs of diverse users and stakeholders.\n\n\"In the interest of food security and safeguarding compliant farmers and other raw water users, no water shall be released from the dams for any individual or entity without a water abstraction agreement while ZINWA will intensify its monitoring capabilities to detect any illegal water use.\"",
