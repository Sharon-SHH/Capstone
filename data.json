    "body": "Lucknow, Feb 28 (IANS) The CSIR-Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), which is known for retrieving natural compounds from aromatic and medicinal plants, will soon set up a unit for the development of a synthetic biology platform for high-value phytomolecules.\n\nSynthetic biology is a science where we change living things on purpose to make them more useful by giving them new abilities through genetic engineering.\n\nCIMAP director Prabodh Kumar Trivedi said: \"The unit will develop phytomolecules, which will be basically molecules produced by plants to protect themselves from moulds, yeasts, bacteria and other harmful organisms. The use of plants and their extracts in human and veterinary medicine has been a well-established fact for ages hence this unit holds great relevance for the pharma industry and others.\"\n\nTrivedi said that the institute has set a goal to work towards the development of a synthetic biology platform, speed up research on plant genome editing, set up standards for herbal products and establish sustainable aroma clusters to double farmer's income this year.\n\nThe scientific institute took the synthetic plant biology route as research in the field of aromatic and medicinal plants and synthetic biology.\n\nThe plant-specialised metabolites (natural products that are not mandated for the vegetative growth of the host plants) are regularly used for medicinal purposes. Plant synthetic biology can enhance the production of bioactive compounds, especially when the native host plants are difficult to cultivate, or the concentration of bioactive compounds are too low for purification.\n\n\"Synthetic biology can change the genetic material in viruses, bacteria, yeasts, plants, or animals to give them useful new characteristics. For example, integrating spider DNA makes a silkworm produce super strong, ultra-lightweight silk. The institute has set up a goal to establish the development of a synthetic biology platform,\" said the CIMAP director.\n\n\"We will also be focussing on accelerating research on plant genome-editing for improved traits in medicinal and aromatic plants,\" he said.\n\n\"We are working on the development of sustainable aroma clusters to enhance the income of the farmers and entrepreneurship development. This will include using solar distillation units (to minimise carbon emission), zero waste (utilisation of de-oiled herb for vermicomposting, mushroom cultivation, cutlery making), Apiculture and the use of agri-drones for disease/nutrient management,\" he said.",

(PHOTO / XINHUA)\n\nMultinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca said on Monday that Shanghai will be its fifth global strategic center, leveraging on the city's as well as China's market strength and reflecting the confidence of the United Kingdom-based company's development in the country.\n\nFollowing the four strategic centers in the UK's Cambridge, Boston and Gaithersburg in the United States, and Gothenburg, Sweden, which all focus on research and development, the one in Shanghai will become another global strategic center but integrates R&D, commercial and production operations.\n\nWe'll make every effort to create a firstclass business environment that is market-oriented, law-based and internationalized, and provide a full range of high-quality services for global enterprises and talent to thrive in Shanghai.\n\nChen Jining, Party secretary of Shanghai\n\nIt will also function as an important strategic fulcrum for Astra-Zeneca's global strategy, R&D and long-term development, the company said.\n\nREAD MORE: Drug giant AstraZeneca to open R&D center, iCampus in HK\n\nChen Jining, Party secretary of Shanghai, met with Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, and his team, the same day.\n\n\"The purpose of leading the global senior management team to Shanghai is to deepen their understanding of China and Shanghai, continue to increase investment in innovation, and carry out more in-depth cooperation with local innovative pharmaceutical companies in China, so as to make greater contributions to promoting high-quality development of Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry and better benefit patients around the world,\" Soriot said.\n\nThe company's Asia-Pacific headquarters, China headquarters and global R&D China center are located in Shanghai.\n\nChen said that biomedicine is one of the three leading industries in Shanghai. Since last year, Shanghai has unveiled a number of innovative policies to support enterprises and promote new breakthroughs in R&D facilitation, innovative drug and device listings as well as clinical trials.\n\n\"We'll make every effort to create a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based and internationalized, and provide a full range of high-quality services for global enterprises and talent to thrive in Shanghai,\" said Chen.\n\nData from the Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission showed that the industrial scale of Shanghai's biomedical industry jumped from 383.3 billion yuan ($53.25 billion) in 2019 to 933.7 billion yuan last year.\n\nSharon Barr, executive vice-president of biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca, said that the proportion of China R&D in the company's global R&D has been growing constantly.\n\n\"Over the past decade, we have 167 studies in China. In addition to that, our China team leads studies that are global. So, from China, we are initiating and leading studies that span the entire planet,\" she said.\n\nBarr also said that in the clinical development space, partners in China have an edge in being creative and innovative.\n\n\"They test new concepts, and they do this at scale with large patient populations. Also, they use innovative approaches, like leveraging investigator-initiated trials to test our molecules in real populations and understand how they're best working. That's a unique and collaborative approach that's not seen everywhere,\" she said.\n\nALSO READ: AstraZeneca to buy Pfizer's rare disease gene therapy portfolio\n\nAstraZeneca also unveiled a plan to assist 30 Shanghai enterprises to go global in 2024. The plan will cover emerging markets involved in the Belt and Road Initiative as well as the US, Japan, and some developed countries in Europe. Through two-way visits, the company will promote cross-border cooperation and exchanges in pharmaceutical innovation.\n\nThis will also help strengthen the connection between Shanghai and the international innovation ecosystem, and enhance the city's international reputation as a science and technology innovation hub, said the company.\n\nGuo Shuting, deputy director of the Shanghai Medical Products Administration, said that among the 10 most representative trades of license-out in the country in 2022, five involved Shanghai-based enterprises with a total amount exceeding $4.7 billion.\n\nTrades of license-out refer to a local enterprise conducting early drug R&D and authorizing the project to other pharmaceutical businesses for later clinical R&D and marketing.",

    "title": "No international oil firm left Nigeria - Minister  --  National Accord Newspaper",
    "body": "The Federal Government said on Tuesday that none of the International Oil Companies (IOCs) doing business in Nigeria has left as against insinuations.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resources (Oil), Heineken Lokpobiri, gave the clarifications during the inauguration of the ongoing Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES 2024), at the Presidential Banquet Hall in Abuja.\n\nHe said the IOCs only shifted their portfolio and investments to offshore.\n\n\"I want to use this opportunity to assure everyone that no IOC is leaving Nigeria. They are only going deep offshore,\" he said.\n\nThe minister said that the divestments by some of the oil companies would benefit the country, as the IOCs would be making further investments in the deep offshore.\n\nThe investments, according to Lokpobiri, will create room for indigenous companies to develop capacity within the onshore and shallow waters space.\n\n\"It is imperative to note that we are strategically managing the divestment processes.\n\n\"Our commitment to enhancing our crude oil reserves and production is unwavering, and we are actively exploring innovative solutions to attract investment, optimise operations and foster sustainable growth.\n\n\"We are open for business and ready to welcome your investments,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Lokpobiri, the transition to cleaner and more sustainable energy sources in the country is inevitable.\n\n\"We are actively pursuing initiatives to position Nigeria as a leader in this energy transition.\n\n\"As we navigate this change, Nigeria recognises the need to strike a balance between meeting our growing energy demand and reducing our carbon footprint.\n\n\"The diversification of our energy mix, investments in renewable energy and the adoption of cleaner technologies are all integral components of our strategy,\" he added.\n\nThe minister explained that investments in Nigeria's oil and gas industry declined by 69 per cent compared to the 28 per cent global average between 2017 to 2022.\n\n\"To further buttress the above, the capital investment to reserve ratio shows the amount of capital deployed to a country's available reserves.\n\n\"Nigeria has an abysmal capital investment-to-reserve ratio of five per cent compared to Angola with 46 per cent; Brazil - 115 per cent; Mozambique - 92 per cent and Guyana - 617 per cent.\n\n\"The window for attracting new investments and exploring our vast reserves is fast narrowing; if the global energy transition accelerates, approximately 60 per cent of Nigeria's reserves could be uncompetitive to produce.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, we have identified that there are so many licenses with proven reserves that are not being optimised in the hands of IOCs, NOCs, and others.\n\n\"In line with Mr President's Renewed Hope agenda, we are working on changing this narrative,\" he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Malam Mele Kyari, Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO), NNPC Ltd., assured that its role in the divestment of the IOCs from onshore and shallow water assets in the country, would serve as a facilitator and not an obstacle.\n\nKyari said that by the virtue of its statutory mandate as the enabler of national energy security, NNPC Ltd.'s role would ensure optimal and sustainable production from the divested assets to guarantee energy security for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\nHe reiterated the company's willingness to invest in the proposed African Energy Bank as a way of ensuring sustainable funding for energy projects in Africa, to guarantee energy security.\n\nOn investment in energy infrastructure to drive energy security, Kyari further said that the completion of the Obiafu-Obrikom-Oben Pipeline was in sight as the tunnelling across the River Niger was currently ongoing.\n\nHe assured stakeholders of the company's commitment to work with them to close the energy deficit gap and create prosperity for Nigerians.\n\nThe NNPC helmsman said that from all indications, all issues of energy scarcity in the country would be over in the next 10 years.\n\nThe event saw the participation of key industry and governmental figures, including Haitham Al-Ghais, Secretary-General of OPEC and Omar Farouk Ibrahim, Secretary-General of the African Petroleum Producers' Organisation, among others.

(PHOTO / XINHUA)\n\nThe C919, China's domestically developed single-aisle passenger jet, and the ARJ21, a regional jet, have begun their two-week demonstration flights in Southeast Asia, indicating a brisk start to their overseas marketing, an expert said.\n\nThe two Chinese-developed aircraft started their demonstration flights at Van Don International Airport in Vietnam on Tuesday. In the two-week period, they will cover Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia, according to their manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China.\n\nThe flights will verify the adaptability of the aircraft models to airports and routes in Southeast Asia, the adaptability of ground service and equipment of local airports, the applicability of special flight procedures, and the economy of commercial operations, COMAC said.\n\nREAD MORE: China's COMAC airplanes begin demonstration flights in SE Asia\n\nDuring the events, the two aircraft will be also on static display, and COMAC will conduct product promotional activities to attract potential customers.\n\n\"By demonstrating the good performance of the aircraft models to its potential customers, COMAC hopes to gain more potential orders and lay the foundation for future market development in Southeast Asia,\" said Lin Zhijie, a civil aviation industry analyst.\n\nThe two planes impressed audiences and experts alike at the Singapore Airshow, the biennial event that concluded on Sunday.\n\nThe ARJ21, China's first domestically developed regional passenger jet, was put into commercial operation in 2016. The model has clocked more than 11 million passenger trips and 127 aircraft have been delivered. With a flying range of 2,225 kilometers to 3,700 km, the ARJ21 is mainly used to meet the transportation demand between major cities and surrounding smaller cities.\n\nTransNusa Airlines, an Indonesian carrier and the first overseas customer of the ARJ21, currently operates two ARJ21 planes. Based in Jakarta, it has launched four routes using the aircraft model, and has transported more than 100,000 passenger trips. With a large number of islands, the country is suitable for the operation of regional airliners.\n\nFor Southeast Asian customers, COMAC has established a regional representative office and built a regional warehouse for aviation materials in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in South China.\n\nALSO READ: C919 aircraft wraps its first overseas debut\n\nNext, relying on customers' own maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, it will build a maintenance network. Besides, the aircraft manufacturer plans to serve Southeast Asian and global customers by setting up training bases near customers and providing customers with high-quality operational support.\n\nThe C919, comparable with the narrow-body Airbus A320 and the Boeing B737 series, has 158 to 192 seats and a flying range of 4,075 km to 5,555 km. The model made its first commercial flight in May 2023. Four C919 jets have been put into commercial operations by Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines and handled more than 130,000 passenger trips.\n\nSo far, the C919 has netted more than 1,100 orders from home and abroad. As the global air travel market continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the C919 is expected to meet growing travel demand and break the market duopoly of Boeing and Airbus.",

    "title": "OPEC+ Could Extend Oil Output Cuts Through Year End - Conservative Angle",
    "body": "OPEC+'s voluntary production cuts that were set to expire at the end of the first quarter could be extended through the end of the year, three OPEC+ sources told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nCrude oil prices jumped with the news from three anonymous OPEC+ sources who spoke to Reuters, indicating that OPEC+ was considering an extension of its voluntary production cuts into the second quarter to lend further support to the market. What's more, the sources suggested that the group could keep the voluntary cuts in place through the end of this year.\n\nIn fact, one of the OPEC+ sources said that the cut extension into the second quarter was \"likely\".\n\nNeither OPEC nor Saudi Arabia's Energy Ministry responded to Reuters' request for comments.\n\nOil prices were trading up more than 1% on the news in afternoon trading. But the oil industry was largely already betting on OPEC+ extending its oil production cuts beyond the first quarter and into the next, a Bloomberg survey showed last Friday. The anonymous survey predicted. According to industry watchers, OPEC+ would be forced to keep the oil off the market, with supply continuing to exceed demand. \"OPEC+ have no choice but to extend the current cuts in order to avoid a meltdown,\" Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM Oil Associates Ltd, said last week.\n\nOPEC+ members collectively decided to voluntarily cut 2.2 million bpd from the group's production this quarter, although much of that was production cuts that were already in effect, including Saudi Arabia's 1 million bpd voluntary cut. Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, has always left the door open to extending the cuts, saying as far back as December that the production cuts could extend beyond March should the market require it.",

    "body": "It currently ranks third in global cities with more than 400 projects with LEED certification\n\nWith the UAE's real estate market on track to reach $710 billion by the end of 2024, Dubai's real estate sector is progressively embracing sustainability to align with key mandates envisioned in the Dubai 2040 Urban Masterplan and UAE Net Zero 2050.\n\nCurrently ranked third in global cities with more than 400 projects with LEED certification, Dubai is spearheading the sustainability drive that is considered an integral part of future-proofing the country's real estate landscape.\n\nMadhav Dhar, chief operating officer and founding member of ZāZEN Properties, said prioritising energy-efficient buildings, efficient design and sustainable construction methods will ensure that upcoming developments mitigate negative environmental impacts.\n\nWith the UAE's leadership extending the Year of Sustainability to 2024, residential projects that make the most of natural light, utilize thicker concrete slabs for improved insulation, and incorporate smart technology, energy-efficient appliances and even renewable energy sources like solar panels, will help step up the drive while contributing to the country's green agenda, Dhar said.\n\nA recent JLL research revealed that buildings with higher levels of green certification can compete with new stock entering the market for longer periods of time. In Dubai, such buildings command 5 per cent to10 per cent higher premiums as compared to green premiums of 11.6 per cent in London, 9.9 per cent across nine major markets in Asia, and 7.1 per cent across eight major markets in the US and Canada.\n\nThe shift from traditional notions of sustainability has further seen a rising demand for certified 'green' buildings aligned with environmental, social, and health considerations. This is crucial for long-term value preservation and future-proofing real estate assets while less sustainable or 'brown' buildings face the risk of devaluation, according to JLL.\n\nThe UAE aims to reduce emissions by 56 per cent in 2030 compared to 2019 levels while also targeting 40 per cent energy efficiency in the construction sector. The UAE's continuous strides in its decarbonisation journey, often in collaboration with the private sector, is driving it towards the 'Climate Aware' phase, which holds great potential for growth as the nation drives climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to achieve Net Zero by 2050, according to Alida Saleh, head of Sustainability - MEA at JLL.\n\nA recent study found that over 80 per cent of UAE residents believe it is time to focus on \"preventing further damage\" rather than \"reversing damage already done.\"\n\n\"With the UAE's real estate sector anticipated to reach a staggering value of $710 billion by the end of 2024, this reinforces the importance of developers prioritizing sustainability in upcoming projects. By emphasizing green practices, the sector can play a pivotal role in achieving the country's carbon emission reduction targets by the half-century mark; yielding the potential to increase the nation's GDP by approximately $1 trillion before 2050 and to simultaneously transform the real estate landscape so that future generations can inherit a more sustainable world,\" ZāZEN Properties said in a statement.\n\nWith a recent survey conducted by UBS Global Wealth Management showing that 75 per cent of UAE investors think that sustainable developments will become the norm in 2030, this notion is backed by the surge in interest in environmentally conscious developments today. While ROI was once thought to be the measure of success, 93 per cent of investors now think that selecting sustainable options won't affect performance but rather enhance longevity.\n\n\"With an increased preference for sustainable real estate, a shift in investment trends is poised to kick off in the UAE and have a positive impact that extends into the coming years. Developers who launch sustainable community-centric developments with world-class amenities can accordingly cater to a variety of consumer preferences and lifestyles, reshape the UAE's real estate landscape, adhere to both regional and global green objectives, and inject added value to the country's economy as a whole,\" said Dhar.\n\nCopyright © 2022 Khaleej Times.

    "body": "The eldest daughter and close aide of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday became the country's first-ever female chief minister in eastern Punjab province. Her rivals accused authorities of nepotism and boycotted the session of the provincial assembly.\n\nMariam Nawaz, 50, became chief minister in a 220-0 vote in her favor, beating out her rival Rana Aftab, nominated by the Sunni Ittehad Council and an ally of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan. Opposition lawmakers supporting Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in parliament in 2022, boycotted the 371-member Punjab Assembly session Monday.\n\nNawaz was later sworn in at the provincial governor's sprawling office in the eastern city of Lahore, her father seen next to her along with other family members during the televised ceremony.\n\nAftab said Nawaz's election was premature as some seats in the assembly reserved for women and minorities have yet be announced. He said her appointment was \"yet another case of nepotism as her family is known for picking relatives and friends to top positions whenever it comes into power.\"\n\nEarlier, one of Nawaz's cousins, Hamza Shehbaz, had also served as chief minister in Punjab.\n\nNawaz thanked God during the ceremony and promised she would equally serve those who voted for her and those who didn't. \"The doors of my heart and office will remain open for the opposition as well,\" she said.\n\nNawaz's appointment was largely expected following the Feb. 8 parliamentary elections in which her father's Pakistan Muslim League party, or PML-N, emerged as the largest party in the National Assembly or lower house of the parliament and in the Punjab Assembly.\n\nThe PML-N, which was initially trailing candidates representing Khan's supporters -- the former cricket player turned Islamist politician was barred from running -- emerged last Friday as the largest single winner in the election after receiving 24 additional seats -- 20 from out of the 60 seats reserved for women, as well as four seats out of 10 reserved for minorities. Nine independent members have also joined the PML-N.\n\nThe PML-N is now heading into a coalition with the Pakistan People's Party, or PPP, with Nawaz's uncle, former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, on a firm path to becoming the next prime minister, his second term in office.\n\nThe Sharifs are one of the top two families that have dominated Pakistani politics for decades. Nawaz Sharif, who served three times as a premier, was ousted from power in 2017 in a graft case. Khan, who replaced Sharif in 2018, granted him permission to travel to London for medical treatment following a court order.\n\nSharif came back to Pakistan from self-imposed exile abroad and returned to politics ahead of the elections. In her father's absence, Nawaz had led political campaigns and taken over his work.",

    "body": "After the earthquake of ChatGPT's phenomenal success a year ago, Silicon Valley investors have gone into overdrive with artificial intelligence, looking for the newest blockbuster idea in an ocean of hype and overpromising.\n\nOpenAI sparked a generative AI craze with ChatGPT, which can pen stories, create pictures, write computer code and more from simple text prompts.\n\nStung by the struggles of cryptocurrency and other faded Silicon Valley fads of recent years, venture capitalists have quickly doubled down on AI, a new promised land in the never-ending quest for big tech riches.\n\nFor the big investors, \"if it's not AI, it's not worth it,\" Denis Barrier, co-founder of venture capital firm Cathay Innovation told AFP after meetings with several investment fund handlers.\n\n\"Funds are looking to make big moves,\" Barrier said.\n\n\"And that's pretty unlikely outside AI in the next few years.\"\n\nWhile layoffs and budget tightening became routine at tech companies last year, startups in the AI sector raised nearly $50 billion from investors, according to market tracker Crunchbase.\n\nIn that first wave of the AI gold rush, investment focused heavily on companies building the large language models that make generative AI features possible.\n\nA record-high $29 billion was invested in generative AI in 2023, according to PitchBook.\n\n- 'Cost lives' -\n\nBut building foundational models from scratch costs a fortune in computing needs and most of that money can only come from the richest of backers -- such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia -- and flow to a chosen few such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThis week Mistral, a buzzy French startup building its own models, secured a new investment from Microsoft after already getting financing from some of Silicon Valley's richest investors, including Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz, one of the sector's most aggressive firms.\n\n\"We believe that any slowdown in AI will cost lives,\" wrote the rock star venture capitalist Marc Andreessen last year in his \"Techno-Optimist Manifesto.\"\n\nBut scared off by the cost of entry, many venture capitalists have turned their attention to more narrowly focused AI startups that could shake up banking, healthcare, energy and other sectors.\n\nCathay recently invested in French biotech startup Bioptimus, which is putting AI to work creating new drugs.\n\nWhile seeking out promising firms, Cathay looked at engineering skill, data access, cost controls, and an ambition to transform a sector, Barrier explained in his downtown office overlooking the San Francisco Bay.\n\n\"You have to have a little faith,\" Barrier said.\n\n\"An application that works can catch on like wildfire; you have to be there first!\"\n\n- 'For real' -\n\nLoora, an Israeli startup that uses generative AI to teach English, raised $12 million last week.\n\nLoora's mobile applications teaches English through conversation and has won more than 15,000 customers who have signed up for about the same price as a Netflix subscription.\n\nSimply embracing AI is not what is going to attract the investors, Loora co-founder Roy Mor told AFP from his headquarters in Tel Aviv.\n\nWhat companies need is more of the right data that will improve the app and improve user experience, he said.\n\n\"I think the use cases where AI really brings value, where it solves problems, are not yet widespread,\" he said.\n\nFor now, the most promise for returns on investment are from the business world, and many startups are focusing there.\n\nAlembic, a specialist in large-scale data analysis -- the heart of AI -- has just raised $14 million.\n\nUsing techniques originally designed to track health data during the coronavirus pandemic, the startup helps determine the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\n\nFormer Walt Disney Studios chairman and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, is a founder of WndrCo, a VC that is backing Alembic.\n\n\"AI is for real,\" the former Hollywood bigwig told AFP.\n\n\"It's not an evolution, but a revolution, a positive revolution.\"\n\njuj-gc-arp/caw\n\nFOX41 Yakima©FOX11 TriCities©",

    "body": "SINGAPORE: There was an air of anticipation at Seletar Airport on Feb 27 as security officers set up barriers and Swifties awaited the arrival of Taylor Swift. Her chartered flight touched down at 5.05pm, and the superstar got off Flight VJT993 - a Bombardier Global Express jet.\n\nThe 34-year-old pop singer, who had concluded the Australian leg of her The Eras Tour at Sydney's Accor Stadium on Feb 26, is on a mission to make more magic at her next stop - Singapore.\n\nAccording to flight-tracking website Flightaware, she set off from Sydney at 11.58am local time (8.58am Singapore time), with the flight taking about eight hours.\n\nWhile not many fans turned up at the airport, Flightradar24, a separate flight-tracking website, showed that Swift's was the most tracked plane as at 5pm, with more than 6,000 people following its flight path.\n\nAmong those who turned up at Seletar Airport hoping to get a glimpse of her was 24-year-old undergraduate Tricia Chan, who was accompanied by her mother, 58-year-old housewife Sophia Chan.\n\nChan said: \"The fact that I am here at the airport is crazy. I have never done this before. But I have been a fan since her debut album, and I am really looking forward to attending the concert on March 9.\" Swift will be performing on March 2, 3, 4, and 7, 8, 9.\n\nUpon landing, Swift and her entourage boarded black Toyota Alphards. There was speculation she would be staying at Marina Bay Sands, the official presenting partner for her tour here.\n\nThe convoy appeared to be heading there, only to bypass the hotel and head for Sentosa, stopping at luxury resort hotel Capella at about 6.20pm.\n\nEven before her first concert at the National Stadium on March 2, Taylormania has swiftly drummed up excitement in the singer's sole South-east Asian destination.\n\nMBS announced on Feb 26 that it will host curated events to celebrate the concerts, including transforming parts of The Shoppes and Sands Expo & Convention Centre into Swift homages and holding a light and water show from Feb 28 to March 7.\n\nIt will also have a retail pop-up at the Sands Expo & Convention Centre's Hall C, which will be open from Feb 29 to March 9.\n\nHotels have also experienced a boom in demand, as more than 300,000 fans from across the region make their way to Singapore. MBS, which offers a slew of premium packages starting from S$10,000, has sold all of them, including a $50,000 package, which includes VIP tickets and passes to tourist attractions. - The Straits Times/ANN",

    "body": "San Francisco - After the earthquake of ChatGPT's phenomenal success a year ago, Silicon Valley investors have gone into overdrive with artificial intelligence, looking for the newest blockbuster idea in an ocean of hype and overpromising.\n\nOpenAI sparked a generative AI craze with ChatGPT, which can pen stories, create pictures, write computer code and more from simple text prompts.\n\nStung by the struggles of cryptocurrency and other faded Silicon Valley fads of recent years, venture capitalists have quickly doubled down on AI, a new promised land in the never-ending quest for big tech riches.\n\nFor the big investors, \"if it's not AI, it's not worth it,\" Denis Barrier, co-founder of venture capital firm Cathay Innovation told AFP after meetings with several investment fund handlers.\n\n\"Funds are looking to make big moves,\" Barrier said.\n\n\"And that's pretty unlikely outside AI in the next few years.\"\n\nWhile layoffs and budget tightening became routine at tech companies last year, startups in the AI sector raised nearly $50 billion from investors, according to market tracker Crunchbase.\n\nIn that first wave of the AI gold rush, investment focused heavily on companies building the large language models that make generative AI features possible.\n\nA record-high $29 billion was invested in generative AI in 2023, according to PitchBook.\n\n- 'Cost lives' -\n\nBut building foundational models from scratch costs a fortune in computing needs and most of that money can only come from the richest of backers -- such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Nvidia -- and flow to a chosen few such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nThis week Mistral, a buzzy French startup building its own models, secured a new investment from Microsoft after already getting financing from some of Silicon Valley's richest investors, including Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz, one of the sector's most aggressive firms.\n\n\"We believe that any slowdown in AI will cost lives,\" wrote the rock star venture capitalist Marc Andreessen last year in his \"Techno-Optimist Manifesto.\"\n\nBut scared off by the cost of entry, many venture capitalists have turned their attention to more narrowly focused AI startups that could shake up banking, healthcare, energy and other sectors.\n\nCathay recently invested in French biotech startup Bioptimus, which is putting AI to work creating new drugs.\n\nWhile seeking out promising firms, Cathay looked at engineering skill, data access, cost controls, and an ambition to transform a sector, Barrier explained in his downtown office overlooking the San Francisco Bay.\n\n\"You have to have a little faith,\" Barrier said.\n\n\"An application that works can catch on like wildfire; you have to be there first!\"\n\n- 'For real' -\n\nLoora, an Israeli startup that uses generative AI to teach English, raised $12 million last week.\n\nLoora's mobile applications teaches English through conversation and has won more than 15,000 customers who have signed up for about the same price as a Netflix subscription.\n\nSimply embracing AI is not what is going to attract the investors, Loora co-founder Roy Mor told AFP from his headquarters in Tel Aviv.\n\nWhat companies need is more of the right data that will improve the app and improve user experience, he said.\n\n\"I think the use cases where AI really brings value, where it solves problems, are not yet widespread,\" he said.\n\nFor now, the most promise for returns on investment are from the business world, and many startups are focusing there.\n\nAlembic, a specialist in large-scale data analysis -- the heart of AI -- has just raised $14 million.\n\nUsing techniques originally designed to track health data during the coronavirus pandemic, the startup helps determine the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.\n\nFormer Walt Disney Studios chairman and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg, is a founder of WndrCo, a VC that is backing Alembic.\n\n\"AI is for real,\" the former Hollywood bigwig told AFP.\n\n\"It's not an evolution, but a revolution, a positive revolution.\"",

    "body": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said the on-going reforms will check rising inflationary trend and address distortions in the foreign exchange market\n\nThe CBN Governor, Yemi Cardoso said this on Tuesday in Abuja, while presenting the communique from the apex bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting.\n\nCardoso had announced the committee's decision to adopt aggressive inflation-targeting by increasing the benchmark interest rate by 400 basis points from 18.75 per cent to 22.75 per cent.\n\nAccording to him, the argument leaned convincingly in favour of a significant policy rate hike to force down inflation substantially\n\nHe said that the MPC deliberated extensively on various distortions in the foreign exchange market, including the activities of speculators, putting upward pressure on the exchange rate with \"high pass-through\" to inflation.\n\nCardoso said that the MPC also identified non-monetary factors driving inflation, like the persisting insecurity and infrastructure deficits.\n\n\"It notes the role of fiscal policy in addressing these shortfalls, while reiterating the commitment of monetary policy support.\n\n\" In this regard, the committee applauded fiscal policy initiatives towards reducing the cost of living for ordinary Nigerians, including the ongoing efforts to improve food supply,\" he said.\n\nHe said that headline inflation rose to 29.90 per cent in January from 28.92 per cent in December 2023.\n\nAccording to him, food inflation increased to 35.41 per cent from 33.93 per cent, while core inflation rose to 23.59 per cent from 23.07 per cent.\n\n\" The major factors driving inflationary\n\npressure remains exchange rate pass-through, rising cost of energy, high fiscal deficits, and lingering security challenges in major food-producing areas.\n\n\"In addition, global factors such as tight financial conditions and trade disruptions from ongoing geo-political tensions, remain significant upside risks to the outlook for domestic inflation.\n\n\"Staff forecasts, therefore, indicate that inflation will remain on an upward trajectory in the near term before commencing a descent,\" he said\n\nHe said that members of the MPC were convinced that the ongoing reforms in the foreign exchange market would yield the desired outcome in the short to medium term.\n\nHe listed some of the reforms to include the unification of the foreign exchange market and promotion of a willing buyer willing seller market.\n\nOthers are removal of all limits on margins for International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) remittances, introduction of a two-way quote system and the broad reforms in the Bureau De Change (BDC) segment of the market.\n\n\"The Committee reviewed the key financial indicators of the banking system and noted that the system remained stable.\n\n\"To further ensure the stability of the banking system, the MPC called on the CBN to increase system buffers by recapitalising the banks to improve resilience against potential risks.\n\n\"Members further enjoined the CBN to strengthen surveillance and compliance regarding its earlier guidance on the application of foreign exchange revaluation gains,\" he said.

    "body": "Prague - Four ex-communist central European countries said Tuesday they were not planning to send troops to Ukraine as they remained torn on military aid to the war-ravaged country battling Russia's invasion.\n\nThe Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovak prime ministers spoke one day after French President Emmanuel Macron refused to rule out the dispatch of Western ground troops to Ukraine \"to ensure that Russia cannot win this war\".\n\nPrague and Warsaw are calling for increased military aid to Ukraine, while Bratislava and Budapest are against.\n\nBut all four EU and NATO members forming the so-called Visegrad Group said they would not send ground troops to Ukraine.\n\n\"We are not considering sending our troops to Ukraine and we have a common position on this point\" with the Czech Republic, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said after meeting Czech counterpart Petr Fiala for bilateral talks in Prague.\n\n\"Today, we have to concentrate, like the Polish and Czech governments have done, on supporting Ukraine fully in its military effort,\" Tusk added.\n\nThe two leaders spoke of their \"common point of view\" on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Tusk promised to support a Czech plan for several NATO members to jointly buy ammunition for Kyiv from third countries.\n\n\"If all EU countries were committed in helping Ukraine like Poland and the Czech Republic, then it would not be necessary to discuss other forms of support for Ukraine,\" he added.\n\n- Common past -\n\nAt a Visegrad Group press conference later in Prague, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said that \"as regards Hungary, we are sending neither weapons nor soldiers over\".\n\nSlovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that at the Paris conference hosted by Macron on Monday, there were \"prime ministers who said they were ready to discuss it and then prime ministers and heads of state who rejected the idea on principle\".\n\n\"We reject it on principle,\" added Fico.\n\nOrban blocked a 50-billion-euro EU aid package for Ukraine for months while Fico has refused to provide military aid to the country, questioning its sovereignty and calling for peace with Russia.\n\nAlso in Prague, Tusk and Fiala expressed their support for the idea of seizing Russian funds around the world, which they said were worth around $300 billion. They said this could be used to support Ukraine financially.\n\nSpeaking alongside Orban and Fico, Tusk recalled the common past the four countries had as satellites of the Soviet Union until 1989.\n\n\"If we accepted Moscow's point of view... the one Putin is presenting, then neither Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary nor Poland would be independent states, and we would still be living under occupation,\" Tusk said.\n\nThe Visegrad Group was founded in 1991, two years after Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland shed the totalitarian communist rule of four decades.\n\nCzechoslovakia split peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993.",

    "body": "PHILADELPHIA -- Bobby Brink barely had time to unpack after being called up from Lehigh Valley when he gave the Flyers the early lead Tuesday in what became a 6-2 win over the Lightning at the malfunctioning Wells Fargo Center.\n\nBrink whistled a wrister past Andrei Vasilevskiy 2:22 into the contest, validating the prayers of John Torterella, who was without injured playmaker Travis Konceny.\n\n\"Hopefully he'll bring some offense,\" the Flyers' coach said of the diminutive Brink. \"We didn't bring him here to check.\"\n\nBrink's goal was the product of focus. A blinding rush up the ice caught the defender and goalkeeper flat on their feet. Brink was on a line with Joel Farabee and Morgan Frost.\n\n\"I'm just going to go out there and do my best and play my game,\" Brink said. \"All I can control is my effort. Every day in the NHL you have to earn your spot. Every game you have to be consistent. You have to be there every night.\"\n\nWith 13:43 left in the opening quarter, the power partially went out at WFC, both on the ice and in the concession areas. (Shouldn't have asked for that receipt).\n\nIt was as if someone dimmed the lights in the seats and in the concession areas. A fleet of service trucks was spotted across the street trying to restore power.\n\nA statement from Wells Fargo Center president Phil Laws referenced \"a partial power outage to limited sections of the arena, which caused a brief pause in game action.\"\n\nThe Flyers exited the first period with a 1-0 lead, but Nicholas Paul tied it up in the second frame for the Lightning. The lights came back on more fully with 16:19 left in the second period, much to the delight of the crowd.\n\nThe scoreboard and the clock weren't functioning though, the time stuck on 13:43. It was pretty much full scoreboard power in the third period, and Tyson Foerster put the Flyers ahead with his 14th goal of the season on a feed from Morgan Frost, his second assist of the evening. Foerster has seven goals in his last seven games for the Flyers.\n\nThe Flyers (31-22-7, 69 points) had lost four of five starts entering Tuesday. They're now tied with the Lightning (32-24-5, 69) in the Eastern Conference.\n\n* * *\n\nJoining Konecny, the Flyers' leading scorer, on the injury report was defenseman Jamie Drysdale, scratched with an injury to his left shoulder. York, who teams with Drysdale, was optimistic about the extent of that issue.\n\n\"I'm not really sure yet exactly what's going on,\" York said. \"I think he avoided the worst case, so that's good. He's just got to stay positive. Just hang in there.\"\n\nKonecny has been hobbled by an upper body injury knocking him out of the last three games.\n\n* * *\n\nSpeaking of injuries, Tortorella's right hand was in a cast, the arm cradled in a sling.\n\nTortorella said the procedure was Monday morning.\n\n* * *\n\nNOTES >> Flyers winger Cam Atkinson also was scratched. ... The Flyers also are without high-priced defenseman Rasmus Ristolainen (upper body), who is on injured reserve",

    "title": "Beware of 'tax reform' that helps rich get richer",
    "body": "Wealth will trickle down from the super rich to ordinary people 'when pigs fly'. Graphic: Isaac Nellist/Green Left\n\nFor some, the name \"Ken Henry\" is almost synonymous with the term \"tax reform\". The former Treasury boss did a major review of the tax system and presented a list of recommendations in 2010, most of which were not implemented by subsequent Coalition and Labor governments.\n\nNow Henry is back in the media, pitching a mild reform of the notorious pro-landlord tax concessions that cost billions of dollars a year and have worsened housing affordability.\n\nThere were some positive reforms in Henry's tax review -- such as raising the tax free threshold, improvements for people on pensions and other welfare payments -- but as a whole they were within the framework of neoliberal \"reform\".\n\nNegative gearing and capital gains tax discounts on the sale of investment properties held for more than a year cost $8.5 billion in foregone tax revenue in 2021-22, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) estimates.\n\nThe foregone revenue of these concessions is estimated to blow out to $157 billion over the next decade.\n\nThe PBO found, and the Treasury has confirmed, that the benefit of these concessions goes overwhelmingly to the richest 10%.\n\nThis is $157 billion that could be spent providing good quality and ecologically sustainable public housing, simultaneously addressing the housing crisis, social justice and the climate crisis.\n\nWhile Henry proposed a reduction in these gross subsidies to the rich, he is pushing harder for a bigger share of taxes to come from the Goods and Services Tax, a regressive tax that hurts the poorest the most. He also champions lowering the corporate tax rate.\n\nTax dodging by the rich is taking place on an industrial scale around the world because of numerous concessions and loopholes that governments shamelessly protect.\n\nAll around the world, the effective tax rates for the rich have halved since the 1980s, according to Oxfam.\n\nMore than $370 billion is estimated to be stashed away in known tax havens by wealthy Australians.\n\nMeanwhile, most people don't enjoy the concessions and tax dodging opportunities that the rich enjoy. Ordinary workers celebrating the extra $15 a week they got from Labor's rework of the Stage 3 tax cuts will soon lose that gain from the combination of cost-of-living increases and bracket creep.\n\nLike so many things under capitalism, the tax system is stacked in favour of the rich.\n\nWe are supposed to swallow the idea that if we keep helping the super rich get even richer, the benefits will eventually trickle down to the rest of us.\n\nAnd pigs will fly.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Green Left has championed the interests of the many and not the few, and promoted the radical changes we need to escape the profit-driven spiral towards ecocide.",

    "body": "The association has forged strategic alliances with rabbit farming associations across Africa, fostering a collaborative ecosystem conducive to knowledge exchange and mutual growth.\n\nTHE government says rabbit farming has emerged as a promising sector within Zimbabwe's agricultural landscape, offering opportunities for economic empowerment, food security and rural development.\n\nOfficiating at the launch of the Zimbabwe Commercial Rabbit Breeders Association (Zicorba) National Rabbit Farmers Training Programme in Harare on Monday, Agriculture deputy minister Davis Marapira said rabbit farming has the potential to play a significant role in the growth of the country's agriculture sector.\n\n\"The development of a well-defined, well-resourced rabbit value chain with requisite skills is essential for maximising the benefits of rabbit farming and the creation of a sustainable industry that can contribute to food security, economic growth, and rural development,\" he said.\n\n\"At the core of the rabbit value chain are the rabbit farmers who raise and breed rabbits for meat, fur, and other products.\"\n\nBy supporting and empowering these farmers through training, access to quality breeding stock, veterinary services, and market linkages, the deputy minister said, the rabbit value chain can be strengthened right from the grassroots level.\n\nThe training programme was sponsored by the Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe,\n\n\"The support from our Chinese partners is invaluable, especially considering China's status as the largest consumer of rabbit meat globally. China consumes a staggering 1 million tonnes of rabbit meat annually, with 600 000 tonnes produced domestically and 400 000 tonnes imported,\" Marapira said.\n\n\"This presents a remarkable opportunity for Zimbabwe to tap into this US$7 billion industry by exporting rabbit meat to China. I am pleased to announce that Zimbabwe now boasts one of the largest rabbit abattoirs in Africa, a development that aligns perfectly with Zicorba's strategy of exporting rabbit meat.\"\n\nHe said local consumption of rabbit meat has been on the rise. The local industry has the potential to generate approximately US$2,5 million in earnings annually.\n\nEconomic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese Embassy, Huang Minghai, said the Asian giant was committed to expanding imports of agricultural products from Zimbabwe.\n\n\"China is Zimbabwe's largest importer of agro-products. In 2023, China imported agro-products from Zimbabwe reached US$682 million, accounting for 40% of China's total imports from Zimbabwe,\" Huang said.\n\n\"Zimbabwean tobacco is well-known in China, and China was the biggest buyer of Zimbabwean tobacco with half of Zimbabwe's tobacco production exported to China.\n\n\"China also imports macadamia nuts and fresh citrus from Zimbabwe, and is negotiating an agreement for the importation of avocados and blueberries from Zimbabwe. China is also the largest consumer of rabbit meat globally; we can also explore the possibility of importing rabbit meat from Zimbabwe in the future.\"\n\nHe said China was committed to strengthening agricultural investment and cooperation with Zimbabwe, with several Chinese companies having entered the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe.\n\nZicorba president Regis Nyamakanga said their primary goal was to facilitate the transition into the cash economy and uplift the livelihoods of 1,5 million households in Zimbabwe through rabbit farming.\n\nHe said under the umbrella of Zicorba, significant progress has been made towards achieving this objective.\n\n\"Notably, we successfully secured investment for the establishment of the country's first rabbit abattoir in May 2021, which has since become one of the largest on the African continent,\" he said.\n\n\"This strategic initiative ensures the hygienic processing of rabbit meat, enhancing the quality and safety standards of our produce. Furthermore, our comprehensive pure breed rollout programme has significantly boosted rabbit production nationwide, positioning Zimbabwe as a leading rabbit-producing nation in Africa.\"\n\nHe said they have partnered private investors to launch a chain of eateries known as rabbit grills. Two establishments are operational, accompanied by a rabbit meat distribution centre aimed at expanding the consumption of rabbit meat -- recognised as one of the healthiest sources of white meat globally.\n\nThe association has forged strategic alliances with rabbit farming associations across Africa, fostering a collaborative ecosystem conducive to knowledge exchange and mutual growth.\n\n\"The future of rabbit farming in Zimbabwe is promising, and we are immensely grateful to the Chinese government for sponsoring our training program,\" Nyamakanga said.\n\nZicorba was established in July 2020 and has emerged as one of the most dynamic and successful farming associations in Zimbabwe, with chapters established across the country's 10 provinces.",

(PHOTO / XINHUA)\n\nThe C919, China's domestically developed single-aisle passenger jet, and the ARJ21, a regional jet, have begun their two-week demonstration flights in Southeast Asia, indicating a brisk start to their overseas marketing, an expert said.\n\nThe two Chinese-developed aircraft started their demonstration flights at Van Don International Airport in Vietnam on Tuesday. In the two-week period, they will cover Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Indonesia, according to their manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China.\n\nThe flights will verify the adaptability of the aircraft models to airports and routes in Southeast Asia, the adaptability of ground service and equipment of local airports, the applicability of special flight procedures, and the economy of commercial operations, COMAC said.\n\nREAD MORE: China's COMAC airplanes begin demonstration flights in SE Asia\n\nDuring the events, the two aircraft will be also on static display, and COMAC will conduct product promotional activities to attract potential customers.\n\n\"By demonstrating the good performance of the aircraft models to its potential customers, COMAC hopes to gain more potential orders and lay the foundation for future market development in Southeast Asia,\" said Lin Zhijie, a civil aviation industry analyst.\n\nThe two planes impressed audiences and experts alike at the Singapore Airshow, the biennial event that concluded on Sunday.\n\nThe ARJ21, China's first domestically developed regional passenger jet, was put into commercial operation in 2016. The model has clocked more than 11 million passenger trips and 127 aircraft have been delivered. With a flying range of 2,225 kilometers to 3,700 km, the ARJ21 is mainly used to meet the transportation demand between major cities and surrounding smaller cities.\n\nTransNusa Airlines, an Indonesian carrier and the first overseas customer of the ARJ21, currently operates two ARJ21 planes. Based in Jakarta, it has launched four routes using the aircraft model, and has transported more than 100,000 passenger trips. With a large number of islands, the country is suitable for the operation of regional airliners.\n\nFor Southeast Asian customers, COMAC has established a regional representative office and built a regional warehouse for aviation materials in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, in South China.\n\nALSO READ: C919 aircraft wraps its first overseas debut\n\nNext, relying on customers' own maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, it will build a maintenance network. Besides, the aircraft manufacturer plans to serve Southeast Asian and global customers by setting up training bases near customers and providing customers with high-quality operational support.\n\nThe C919, comparable with the narrow-body Airbus A320 and the Boeing B737 series, has 158 to 192 seats and a flying range of 4,075 km to 5,555 km. The model made its first commercial flight in May 2023. Four C919 jets have been put into commercial operations by Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines and handled more than 130,000 passenger trips.\n\nSo far, the C919 has netted more than 1,100 orders from home and abroad. As the global air travel market continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the C919 is expected to meet growing travel demand and break the market duopoly of Boeing and Airbus.",

Speaking to ANI, AIUDF MLA Karim Uddin Barbhuiya said, \"We will try to form the government in Assam in 2026 with the help of regional parties. How long will Himanta Biswa Sarma's dictatorship last? The people of Assam want change, but the current main opposition party is not ready. We will form the government in Assam in 2031 with the blessings of the people of the state,\" Karim Uddin Barbhuiya said.\n\nBarbhuiya predicted a decline of Congress in Assam, attributing it to Congress leaders allegedly collaborating with the BJP. \"We will try to protect the seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The Congress leaderships in Assam are totally in touch with BJP. One after one Congress leader are now joining the BJP. We are worried about the result of Congress, but they don't because they have a good relation with the Chief Minister.

    "body": "The association has forged strategic alliances with rabbit farming associations across Africa, fostering a collaborative ecosystem conducive to knowledge exchange and mutual growth.\n\nTHE government says rabbit farming has emerged as a promising sector within Zimbabwe's agricultural landscape, offering opportunities for economic empowerment, food security and rural development.\n\nOfficiating at the launch of the Zimbabwe Commercial Rabbit Breeders Association (Zicorba) National Rabbit Farmers Training Programme in Harare on Monday, Agriculture deputy minister Davis Marapira said rabbit farming has the potential to play a significant role in the growth of the country's agriculture sector.\n\n\"The development of a well-defined, well-resourced rabbit value chain with requisite skills is essential for maximising the benefits of rabbit farming and the creation of a sustainable industry that can contribute to food security, economic growth, and rural development,\" he said.\n\n\"At the core of the rabbit value chain are the rabbit farmers who raise and breed rabbits for meat, fur, and other products.\"\n\nBy supporting and empowering these farmers through training, access to quality breeding stock, veterinary services, and market linkages, the deputy minister said, the rabbit value chain can be strengthened right from the grassroots level.\n\nThe training programme was sponsored by the Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe,\n\n\"The support from our Chinese partners is invaluable, especially considering China's status as the largest consumer of rabbit meat globally. China consumes a staggering 1 million tonnes of rabbit meat annually, with 600 000 tonnes produced domestically and 400 000 tonnes imported,\" Marapira said.\n\n\"This presents a remarkable opportunity for Zimbabwe to tap into this US$7 billion industry by exporting rabbit meat to China. I am pleased to announce that Zimbabwe now boasts one of the largest rabbit abattoirs in Africa, a development that aligns perfectly with Zicorba's strategy of exporting rabbit meat.\"\n\nHe said local consumption of rabbit meat has been on the rise. The local industry has the potential to generate approximately US$2,5 million in earnings annually.\n\nEconomic and commercial counsellor at the Chinese Embassy, Huang Minghai, said the Asian giant was committed to expanding imports of agricultural products from Zimbabwe.\n\n\"China is Zimbabwe's largest importer of agro-products. In 2023, China imported agro-products from Zimbabwe reached US$682 million, accounting for 40% of China's total imports from Zimbabwe,\" Huang said.\n\n\"Zimbabwean tobacco is well-known in China, and China was the biggest buyer of Zimbabwean tobacco with half of Zimbabwe's tobacco production exported to China.\n\n\"China also imports macadamia nuts and fresh citrus from Zimbabwe, and is negotiating an agreement for the importation of avocados and blueberries from Zimbabwe. China is also the largest consumer of rabbit meat globally; we can also explore the possibility of importing rabbit meat from Zimbabwe in the future.\"\n\nHe said China was committed to strengthening agricultural investment and cooperation with Zimbabwe, with several Chinese companies having entered the agricultural sector in Zimbabwe.\n\nZicorba president Regis Nyamakanga said their primary goal was to facilitate the transition into the cash economy and uplift the livelihoods of 1,5 million households in Zimbabwe through rabbit farming.\n\nHe said under the umbrella of Zicorba, significant progress has been made towards achieving this objective.\n\n\"Notably, we successfully secured investment for the establishment of the country's first rabbit abattoir in May 2021, which has since become one of the largest on the African continent,\" he said.\n\n\"This strategic initiative ensures the hygienic processing of rabbit meat, enhancing the quality and safety standards of our produce. Furthermore, our comprehensive pure breed rollout programme has significantly boosted rabbit production nationwide, positioning Zimbabwe as a leading rabbit-producing nation in Africa.\"\n\nHe said they have partnered private investors to launch a chain of eateries known as rabbit grills. Two establishments are operational, accompanied by a rabbit meat distribution centre aimed at expanding the consumption of rabbit meat -- recognised as one of the healthiest sources of white meat globally.\n\nThe association has forged strategic alliances with rabbit farming associations across Africa, fostering a collaborative ecosystem conducive to knowledge exchange and mutual growth.\n\n\"The future of rabbit farming in Zimbabwe is promising, and we are immensely grateful to the Chinese government for sponsoring our training program,\" Nyamakanga said.\n\nZicorba was established in July 2020 and has emerged as one of the most dynamic and successful farming associations in Zimbabwe, with chapters established across the country's 10 provinces.",

    "body": "Chinese astronaut Tang Hongbo. (PHOTO PROVIDED TO CHINA DAILY)\n\nSenior Colonel Tang Hongbo ended his 216th day in orbit on Tuesday, extending his lead as the Chinese astronaut to have spent the longest time in space.\n\nThe 48-year-old from Hunan province is a member of China's second generation of astronauts and mission commander of the ongoing Shenzhou XVII mission. He is also the first person to have returned to China's Tiangong space station.\n\nTang made his first journey into space in June 2021, on the three-month Shenzhou XII mission, becoming one of the space station's first inhabitants.\n\nREAD MORE: China's Shenzhou XVII space mission ready to launch\n\nDuring that mission, he spent 92 days and four hours in orbit.\n\nOn Oct 26, Tang and two crewmates, Lieutenant Colonel Tang Shengjie and Lieutenant Colonel Jiang Xinlin, set out on the Shenzhou XVII mission, arriving at the Tiangong station that afternoon.\n\nBy noon on Monday, Tang Hongbo's current mission had lasted 123 days, taking his total time in orbit to 215 days.\n\nThat meant he surpassed Chen Dong, who previously held the record for the longest time in-orbit for a Chinese astronaut after spending a total of 214 days and 15 hours in orbit on two space missions.\n\nThe Shenzhou XVII mission crew is scheduled to spend over two more months in orbit, which means Tang Hongbo will return to Earth having clocked about 280 days of orbital flight.\n\nALSO READ: Shenzhou XVII crew conducts 1st spacewalk\n\nHe has also made two space flights within the shortest interval -- two years and one month -- of any Chinese astronaut.\n\nTwenty Chinese astronauts have been in space on 12 space flights.\n\nAmong them, Tang Hongbo, Chen Dong and Jing Haipeng -- the first Chinese astronaut with four spaceflights -- each have more than 200 hours in orbit.\n\nOleg Dmitriyevich Kononenko, a 59-year-old Russian cosmonaut, boasts the longest time in space of any astronaut in the world. He has accumulated more than 900 days in orbit during his five flights to the International Space Station, including his current one-year flight.",

    "title": "How African mass markets make  productive use of gossip and the grapevine",
    "body": "AMONG several aspects that make African mass markets more inclusive and resilient than formal corporate marketing systems is the ability to make use of gossip and the grapevine productively.\n\nOne of the questions continually asked by agricultural economists and policymakers is: Who sets the price in African mass markets?\n\nThis is a legitimate question especially from people who have gone through the formal education system where it is assumed that there has to be a committee that sits down to set commodity prices.\n\nGossip and the grapevine have enormous influence on price setting in fluid African mass markets where there is often no institution responsible for consolidating data from thousands of economic actors participating in a single ecosystem.\n\nBesides directing price setting, gossip and the grapevine are largely responsible for influencing other critical aspects like measurements for different commodities as informed by gluts and shortages. If you want to understand how human instinct directs people's behaviour in their workplaces, visit the nearest African mass market.\n\nFarmers and traders who participate in mass markets have become adept at using gossip and the grapevine in acquiring the ability to process real-time information. Whereas in formal institutions like supermarkets, price-setting is directed by the board and management, in mass markets price-setting decisions are informed by the fluid state of affairs.\n\nNo wonder the price of tomatoes is usually the same among traders selling the same commodity in the same market. Depending on various uses, the trading of livestock in African mass markets tends to follow a pathway shaped by gossip and the grapevine. This is also partly because there are no formal structures of marketing goats and indigenous chickens.\n\nWhat also differentiates mass markets from formal companies is that mass market actors understand the special role of leaders like market committees that are also participants in selling commodities in the same market. Being active participants, market committees appreciate difficulties in implementing changes within fluid market operations and pathways for overcoming such challenges. By using their power constructively, market leaders enhance social and economic harmony.\n\nChallenging the superficial notion of market linkages\n\nMany government departments, development agencies and formal private actors have a rather superficial notion of market linkages as a simple process of connecting farmers with formal buyers.\n\nYet in practice, serious farmers can easily visit buyers like wholesalers, hotels, processors and many others with no need for someone to arrange such engagements because several formal companies have marketing personnel and contact details like mobile numbers which rural farmers can easily use to stay in touch.\n\nThe fact that mass markets continue to thrive although formal markets that are supported by policies and banks exist is a sign that market linkage is more than connecting farmers with buyers.\n\nWhile the notion of market linkages is also an integral component of cartels, there are several examples of how and why formal market linkage arrangements have failed to solve challenges for the majority of smallholder farmers. If anything, market linkages tend to benefit formal companies. Across Africa, there have been several noble attempts by development organisations and government departments to connect grain buyers with producer co-operatives.\n\nRiding on the proliferation of mobile phones, these interventions have set up simple text messaging systems where a co-operative or commodity association can broadcast to all registered buyers with a single text. That text describes quantities and qualities and, if desired, the expected price. In the same way a buyer could send one text stating requirements that will be delivered to all registered co-operatives that will have been trained in post-harvest quality management and marketing.\n\nDespite high hopes that such systems would overcome several marketing-related constraints, they have not addressed marketing challenges because the implementers have not taken into account the larger market ecosystem in which individual farmers have long-held personal relationships with diverse traders in mass markets.\n\nA more surprising lesson has been that marketing managers in formal companies have used lack of market information to secure favours from big buyers who have in turn granted those favours to cut out competition.\n\nThe same happens in formal settings where formal companies apply to government for permits to import some foodstuffs. Information asymmetry is used to issue permits for the importation of commodities that are often abundant in some parts of the country. On the contrary, through gossip and the grapevine, mass markets are often the first to know which commodity will be in short or over supply in the next week as well as who is importing what well before policymakers or regulators know what is happening. Using evidence to correct assumptions about digital marketing in African markets\n\nAmong other organisations, eMKambo (www.emkambo.co.zw) has been working with African mass markets for more than a decade. After learning that most farmers associated authentic information with voice and did not really trust text messages, eMKambo introduced audios and radio as part of the knowledge exchange platform. Another initial assumption was that mobile apps will solve challenges related to information asymmetry but there is a realisation that mobile apps introduced information overload which busy farmers and traders had no time for. In fact, the speed of transactions in African mass food markets does not allow traders to spend time on a mobile app.\n\nSome telling mixed results were also experienced in Rwanda through attempts to link farmers and buyers on a platform called Viamo. Based on a successful trial in Nepal where linkages between farmers and buyers of harvested produce were done through basic mobile channels, a similar system was set up in Rwanda but the experience in Rwanda turned out very differently. A toll-free service was established with MTN where all MTN subscribers had 10 free calls each month. The service had content for health, education, agriculture and other topics. All in Kinyarwanda and accessible in both USSD and audio (interactive voice response). On average, there were around 900 000 unique callers to the service each month, beating Facebook, X and Instagram combined.\n\nAn option was introduced for farmers and buyers on the toll-free service where farmers could register their location and crop for sale, and buyers could register their desired crop and desired location. The system would then match farmers and buyers and each would receive an SMS with the phone numbers of one another. However, the results were not that encouraging with few buyers and farmers following up and contacting one another. Some of the critical learnings included the need to invest heavily in marketing digital services among farmers in order to increase registrations.\n\nAnother learning was that most buyers heavily relied on their personal/professional networks which were based on relations created over time. However, the most significant learning was that providing a new digital way to engage without personal connections is very difficult as trust between farmers and buyers cannot easily be established through simple mobile connections and mobile conversations. To be fairly successful, such solutions have to be situated within existing ecosystems, where the main players already know and trust one another through gossip and the grapevine which is typical of the way African markets function progressively. That is why, to a large extent, attempts to formalise the informal sector without making sense of all these dynamics is a very stupid action!",

    "body": "ZIMBABWE is set to finance its 2024 total budget financing gap of ZWL$9,2 trillion through domestic and external borrowing, a development that will further sink the country deep into debt.\n\nAccording to the latest annual borrowing plan released by the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO), the total budget financing gap amounts to ZWL$9,2 trillion.\n\nIt comprises a budget deficit of ZWL$4,3 trillion (1,5% of gross domestic product) and amortisation of loans and maturing government securities estimated at ZWL$4,9 trillion.\n\nThe 2024 National Budget had projected revenues of ZWL$54 trillion against an estimated expenditures of ZWL$58 trillion.\n\n\"The gross financing gap will be financed through domestic and external borrowing as follows: Issuance of Treasury bills and bonds amounting to ZWL$5,8 trillion; disbursements from existing external loans amounting to ZWL$367 billion and new external loan disbursements amounting to ZWL$2,9 trillion,\" the report read.\n\nFurther borrowing will balloon Zimbabwe's debt, which is estimated at US$20 billion.\n\nHowever, the PDMO is optimistic that the uptake for medium to long-term government securities will increase given the projected stable macro-economic environment, characterised by low inflation and a stable exchange rate.\n\nThis comes as the macroeconomic environment is characterised by a sharp depreciation of the local currency and high inflation rate, with the International Monetary Fund indicating that the Zimbabwe dollar has lost about 95% of its buying power since December last year.\n\n\"Government securities, the baseline assumption is to issue Treasury bills and bonds through the auction system and private placements. From the existing external loans, projected disbursements amount to ZWL$366,6 billion (US$40,8 million),\" the report read in part.\n\n\"In 2024, new external loan disbursements for budget support and central government projects are projected at ZWL$2,9 trillion (US$330 million).\"\n\n\"The strategy is to gradually lengthen the maturities of government securities going forward. Uptake for medium to long-term government securities is expected to increase given the projected stable macroeconomic environment, characterised by low inflation and a stable exchange rate.\"\n\nThe report noted that the annual borrowing plan seeks to promote the growth of the domestic debt market by issuing Treasury bills and bonds while the government raises its financing requirements through the auction system to promote medium to long-term Treasury bonds and adherence to prescribed asset status.\n\n\"The strategy seeks to promote the development of the secondary market by issuing medium-to-long-term Treasury bonds and to enforce adherence to the prescribed asset status, for insurance companies and pension funds as required by law.\"\n\nThe report noted that the strategy in external financing is to prioritise concessional financing and to limit non-concessional borrowing to economically viable projects.\n\n\"The objectives of public debt management in Zimbabwe are provided for in Section 3 of the Public Debt Management Act (Chapter: 22:21) as: \"to ensure that government's needs and payment obligations are met at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long term, with a prudent level of risk, and to promote the development of the domestic debt market,\" the report read.\n\n\"The primary objective requires an assessment of cost and risk in relation to government borrowings and debt service. The secondary objective aims to support the development of an efficient and robust domestic debt market.\"",

    "body": "The microfinance sector, like the rest of the financial services sector, has also been victim to policy inconsistencies especially around currency resulting in massive loss of value.\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Association of Microfinance Institutions (Zamfi) has urged players in the sector to be innovative and introduce new products that are designed as low risk and have high returns for the benefit of the borrowing clients.\n\nIn its 2023 microfinance sector performance analysis report, Zamfi said industry players should support borrowing clients who have stood with them through difficult times.\n\n\"As at December 31 2023, profitability and sustainability as measured by operational self-sufficiency ratio return on asset and equity was of 169,3%, 20,8% and 89,9% compared with 157,3%, 13,5% and 58,6% reported 30 September 2023, respectively.\"\n\nCapital adequacy for the sector was rated strong during the period with the credit -- only microfinance sector reporting aggregate equity capital of ZWL$108,5billion, up from ZWL$98,7 billion reported for the quarter ending September 30, 2023.\n\nDebt capital amounted to ZWL$281,8 billion during the period, a jump from ZWL$163,5 billion recorded the previous quarter.\n\nThe aggregate of equity and debt represented total capital available for funding amounting to ZWL$390,3 billion during the period.\n\nZamfi added that the capital, being a combination of local currency and foreign-denominated capital, was not under threat of foreign exchange risks.\n\n\"This is being made possible by the government extension of the use of the multi-currency system to 2030 and central banks authorisation of lending in US$ for microfinance institutions,\" it said.\n\n\"Going forward, the sector is poised for incremental growth as more individuals and business clients quickly seek funding from the microfinance sector, which is not entirely guaranteed from the banking sector.\n\n\"The microfinance business model is known for being agile and easily adaptable to dynamic changes and shifts in the operating environment including demands from the borrowing clients.\"\n\nZamfi urged the government to be consistent in policy making and implement credible policies aimed at solving social-economic challenges.\n\nThe microfinance sector, like the rest of the financial services sector, has also been victim to policy inconsistencies especially around currency resulting in massive loss of value.\n\nThe association said the overall performance of the sector for the financial year under review, reflected an industry that has remained resilient and financially sustainable in spite of the many economic headwinds characterised by rapid depreciation of the local currency, price instability, geopolitical events and sluggish economic growth.\n\nDuring the year, the sector reported total income of ZWL$238,2 billion against total operating expenses of ZWL$140,6 billion, leading to a net profit position of ZWL$97,6 billion.\n\nDue to the existence of a multi-currency regime, Zamfi said both the revenue streams and cost drivers of the business were largely being gained and incurred in hard currency and as such contributing to the sustainability of the sector.",

    "body": "Hundreds of millions of dollars will soon land in state coffers to improve the health of the delicate Murray-Darling Basin.\n\nThe exact figure is due to be revealed in the coming weeks after the Albanese government revised the Murray-Darling Basin plan to deliver promised environmental flows over an extended period.\n\n\"It is in the realm of hundreds of millions of dollars,\" NSW Water Minister Rose Jackson told a budget estimates hearing on Wednesday.\n\n\"My understanding is that we've completed all the work that we need to conclude at our end and that we're just waiting on the Commonwealth to do the same.\"\n\nA July report found the 12-year plan to restore Australia's largest and most complex river system to a sustainable level could not meet its June 2024 deadline.\n\nSouth Australia has described part of the revised plan - a deal to return 450 gigalitres of water to the environment by 2027 - as the \"bare minimum\" to ensure the river's ecology can withstand the next drought.\n\nThe plan is backed by NSW but has faced fierce opposition from Victoria.\n\nWhat portion of the 450GL target would fall at NSW's feet remained unclear, Ms Jackson said.\n\nShe reaffirmed her state would not be involved in the water buyback market, in which farmers are paid to reduce their water take, noting research showing \"unstrategic\" rounds of federal intervention had skewed the market and hurt communities.\n\nFederal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek has suggested the Commonwealth will re-enter the market again this year.\n\nBut Ms Jackson flagged the introduction of tighter rules governing private irrigators to make it clear who could take water when and in what volume.\n\nIt follows a Bloomberg report exposing a confidential agreement by a water provider to withhold more than a hundred billion litres of water from users at the height of NSW's last drought, in 2019.\n\n\"These private irrigation organisations ... play an important role,\" Ms Jackson said.\n\n\"But honestly, considering their scale and their market power, I don't think that the current level of regulatory oversight is necessarily adequate.\"\n\nThe community needed more clarity from a state minister who had been in the job for nearly a year, opposition water spokeswoman Steph Cooke said.\n\n\"The minister failed to provide communities and stakeholders with any confidence around the opaque deal they've done with the Commonwealth on the Murray-Darling Basin plan,\" she said.\n\n\"We still don't know what they've signed us up to and, alarmingly, the minister doesn't even seem to know the amount of water the Commonwealth is seeking from NSW.\"\n\nMs Cooke said the minister had admitted that nothing had been done to put in place the structural adjustment packages needed should buybacks eventuate.",

    "title": "How African mass markets make  productive use of gossip and the grapevine",
    "body": "AMONG several aspects that make African mass markets more inclusive and resilient than formal corporate marketing systems is the ability to make use of gossip and the grapevine productively.\n\nOne of the questions continually asked by agricultural economists and policymakers is: Who sets the price in African mass markets?\n\nThis is a legitimate question especially from people who have gone through the formal education system where it is assumed that there has to be a committee that sits down to set commodity prices.\n\nGossip and the grapevine have enormous influence on price setting in fluid African mass markets where there is often no institution responsible for consolidating data from thousands of economic actors participating in a single ecosystem.\n\nBesides directing price setting, gossip and the grapevine are largely responsible for influencing other critical aspects like measurements for different commodities as informed by gluts and shortages. If you want to understand how human instinct directs people's behaviour in their workplaces, visit the nearest African mass market.\n\nFarmers and traders who participate in mass markets have become adept at using gossip and the grapevine in acquiring the ability to process real-time information. Whereas in formal institutions like supermarkets, price-setting is directed by the board and management, in mass markets price-setting decisions are informed by the fluid state of affairs.\n\nNo wonder the price of tomatoes is usually the same among traders selling the same commodity in the same market. Depending on various uses, the trading of livestock in African mass markets tends to follow a pathway shaped by gossip and the grapevine. This is also partly because there are no formal structures of marketing goats and indigenous chickens.\n\nWhat also differentiates mass markets from formal companies is that mass market actors understand the special role of leaders like market committees that are also participants in selling commodities in the same market. Being active participants, market committees appreciate difficulties in implementing changes within fluid market operations and pathways for overcoming such challenges. By using their power constructively, market leaders enhance social and economic harmony.\n\nChallenging the superficial notion of market linkages\n\nMany government departments, development agencies and formal private actors have a rather superficial notion of market linkages as a simple process of connecting farmers with formal buyers.\n\nYet in practice, serious farmers can easily visit buyers like wholesalers, hotels, processors and many others with no need for someone to arrange such engagements because several formal companies have marketing personnel and contact details like mobile numbers which rural farmers can easily use to stay in touch.\n\nThe fact that mass markets continue to thrive although formal markets that are supported by policies and banks exist is a sign that market linkage is more than connecting farmers with buyers.\n\nWhile the notion of market linkages is also an integral component of cartels, there are several examples of how and why formal market linkage arrangements have failed to solve challenges for the majority of smallholder farmers. If anything, market linkages tend to benefit formal companies. Across Africa, there have been several noble attempts by development organisations and government departments to connect grain buyers with producer co-operatives.\n\nRiding on the proliferation of mobile phones, these interventions have set up simple text messaging systems where a co-operative or commodity association can broadcast to all registered buyers with a single text. That text describes quantities and qualities and, if desired, the expected price. In the same way a buyer could send one text stating requirements that will be delivered to all registered co-operatives that will have been trained in post-harvest quality management and marketing.\n\nDespite high hopes that such systems would overcome several marketing-related constraints, they have not addressed marketing challenges because the implementers have not taken into account the larger market ecosystem in which individual farmers have long-held personal relationships with diverse traders in mass markets.\n\nA more surprising lesson has been that marketing managers in formal companies have used lack of market information to secure favours from big buyers who have in turn granted those favours to cut out competition.\n\nThe same happens in formal settings where formal companies apply to government for permits to import some foodstuffs. Information asymmetry is used to issue permits for the importation of commodities that are often abundant in some parts of the country. On the contrary, through gossip and the grapevine, mass markets are often the first to know which commodity will be in short or over supply in the next week as well as who is importing what well before policymakers or regulators know what is happening. Using evidence to correct assumptions about digital marketing in African markets\n\nAmong other organisations, eMKambo (www.emkambo.co.zw) has been working with African mass markets for more than a decade. After learning that most farmers associated authentic information with voice and did not really trust text messages, eMKambo introduced audios and radio as part of the knowledge exchange platform. Another initial assumption was that mobile apps will solve challenges related to information asymmetry but there is a realisation that mobile apps introduced information overload which busy farmers and traders had no time for. In fact, the speed of transactions in African mass food markets does not allow traders to spend time on a mobile app.\n\nSome telling mixed results were also experienced in Rwanda through attempts to link farmers and buyers on a platform called Viamo. Based on a successful trial in Nepal where linkages between farmers and buyers of harvested produce were done through basic mobile channels, a similar system was set up in Rwanda but the experience in Rwanda turned out very differently. A toll-free service was established with MTN where all MTN subscribers had 10 free calls each month. The service had content for health, education, agriculture and other topics. All in Kinyarwanda and accessible in both USSD and audio (interactive voice response). On average, there were around 900 000 unique callers to the service each month, beating Facebook, X and Instagram combined.\n\nAn option was introduced for farmers and buyers on the toll-free service where farmers could register their location and crop for sale, and buyers could register their desired crop and desired location. The system would then match farmers and buyers and each would receive an SMS with the phone numbers of one another. However, the results were not that encouraging with few buyers and farmers following up and contacting one another. Some of the critical learnings included the need to invest heavily in marketing digital services among farmers in order to increase registrations.\n\nAnother learning was that most buyers heavily relied on their personal/professional networks which were based on relations created over time. However, the most significant learning was that providing a new digital way to engage without personal connections is very difficult as trust between farmers and buyers cannot easily be established through simple mobile connections and mobile conversations. To be fairly successful, such solutions have to be situated within existing ecosystems, where the main players already know and trust one another through gossip and the grapevine which is typical of the way African markets function progressively. That is why, to a large extent, attempts to formalise the informal sector without making sense of all these dynamics is a very stupid action!",

Huawei's Board Member and President of ICT Products & Solutions Yang Chaobin delivered a keynote where he talked about \"Embracing the Intelligent Era with Highly Autonomous Networks\".\n\nYang Chaobin delivering a keynote\n\nTM Forum proposed the concept of autonomous networks (AN) in 2019. In just four years, a solid consensus has been reached on AN as the way forward for automation and intelligence. With a few leading operators already having achieved L3 autonomy in key scenarios, the value of AN is becoming increasingly clear. Yang said: \"The upgrade from L3 to L4 will accelerate value creation. It will reshape interaction models to change how O&M is performed, reshape the system capabilities that improve O&M efficiency, reshape the service processes that improve operations efficiency, and reshape integration models to shorten service TTM. This will help operators achieve their strategic goal of L4 autonomy.\"\n\nBreakthroughs in key technologies are the foundation for enhanced value creation with L4 autonomy, he went on to explain. \"Telecom foundation models are a key technology that enables autonomous network upgrades from L3 to L4 autonomy. The Huawei Telecom Foundation Model provides role-based copilots and scenario-based agents that help operators empower employees and improve user satisfaction.\"\n\nAt the event, Yang also presented their Net Master offering, an example of the foundation model's applications. Net Master has already been piloted in China Mobile's IP network O&M in Guangdong province. Net Master comes with both the copilot and agent functions to help field engineers and NOC O&M engineers work efficiently. With Net Master, 90% of faults can be automatically diagnosed, and the fault locating time can be shortened from hours to minutes.\n\nIn addition to presenting these technological breakthroughs, Yang called on industry partners to collaborate to improve the Autonomous Networks Framework (ANF) and develop a unified assessment system. He also noted that operators should focus on talent and process transformations, and technology vendors will need to focus on expansion of and innovation in key scenarios that can boost value creation for operators.\n\nHuawei plans to actively foster industry best practices for telecom foundation models, facilitate L4 autonomous networks, and build higher-quality networks.",

    "body": "CANBERRA, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's inflation rate remained steady at 3.4 percent in the year to January, data revealed on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, consumer prices rose 3.4 percent in the 12 months to January, the same annual rate as the 12 months to December 2023 and the equal-lowest annual figure since November 2021.\n\nThe Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that economists had generally forecast inflation would rise to 3.6 percent in January.\n\nThe statistics bureau identified a 4.6 percent rise in housing costs between January 2023 and January 2024 and a 4.4 percent rise in food and non-alcoholic beverage prices in the same period as the main drivers of inflation.\n\n\"Annual inflation remains elevated for food, apart from fresh food categories. Meat and seafood and fruit and vegetables, for example, saw lower or negative annual inflation,\" Michelle Marquardt, head of price statistics at the bureau, said in a statement.\n\nAlcohol and tobacco prices grew 6.7 percent and the cost of insurance and financial services increased 8.2 percent in the 12 months to January.\n\nThose increases were partially offset by a 7.1 percent fall in holiday travel and accommodation costs.\n\nThe price of electricity increased 0.8 percent, but Marquardt said that if not for a government rebate scheme that started in July 2023 it would have increased 15.3 percent in the year to January. ■",

    "body": "Russia's top security official and Vladimir Putin ally Nikolai Patrushev promised \"comprehensive support\" to Russian allies in Latin America against U.S. \"interference\" during a meeting with officials from Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua, hosted in Managua on Tuesday.\n\n\"You are well aware of the aggressive methods of the United States of forcibly breaking down governments that do not suit them, political pressure and economic containment of states demonstrating independence,\" Russian Security Council Secretary Patrushev was quoted saying in a report by Russia's official newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\n\nThe presence of intelligence officials in Russian delegations abroad is rarely disclosed by the country's state media. But the newspaper reported that Patrushev traveled with officials from Russian spy agencies like the Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service in addition to officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and other government agencies.\n\nPictures from Russian media outlets show Cuban Interior Minister Lázaro Alberto Álvarez Casas attended the meeting.\n\nAt a time when Russia faces increasing isolation over its invasion of Ukraine, Patrushev said Latin America, a region traditionally thought as closer to the United States, is gaining \"growing importance\" for Russia, the report says. His trip to Latin America, which included a Monday stop in Cuba, happened just days after Russia's foreign minister met with Cuban and Venezuelan leaders on his way to attend a G-20 meeting in Brazil.\n\nPatrushev said Moscow is ready to provide \"full, comprehensive support to our Latin American friends, including preventing interference in the internal affairs of countries friendly to us, discrediting their legitimate authorities, intimidating the population, and destabilizing the economy.\"\n\nThe official hinted Russia's support is critical at a time when some of these countries are headed to elections, in reference to Venezuela, where strongman Nicolás Maduro has stepped back from efforts to improve relations with the United States and has broken commitments his government made to the opposition in a deal negotiated with U.S. support.\n\nPatrushev is expected to meet Nicaraguan authoritarian leader Daniel Ortega and his wife and vice president, Rosario Murillo, on Wednesday.\n\nBut first, Patrushev landed in Cuba on Monday, where he held a private meeting with retired Gen. Raul Castro to discuss \"issues of practical cooperation between Russia and Cuba in the field of security,\" according to Rossiyskaya Gazeta, reinforcing views that despite being out of office, the 92-year old revolutionary leader is still making important military and political decisions.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe report noted that Castro was \"cheerful and energetic\" and joked with Patrushev, whom he called \"my old friend.\"\n\nIn a separate meeting, the Russian senior official also discussed security issues and economic cooperation with the country's handpicked president, Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n\nIn recent years, Russia and Cuba have strengthened military and diplomatic ties, and since Russia's invasion of Ukraine the pace of the exchanges has dramatically increased, a development that has irritated the U.S. government. Patrushev previously traveled to Cuba in 2019 and in March of last year.\n\nThe communist government is also trying to attract Russian investments and credits to try to salvage the island's moribund socialist economy. But Russian officials have urged the government to speed up its own market reforms.\n\nIn Díaz-Canel's talks with the Russian top adviser, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported that the Cuban leader praised Putin's recent interview with former Fox host Tucker Carlson, an hours-long exchange in which the Russian leader tried to provide historical justifications for his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDíaz-Canel said the interview showed Putin's \"undeniable leadership in the world.\"\n\n©2024 Miami Herald.

    "body": "Headline: Huawei Yang Chaobin: Embracing the Intelligent Era with Highly Autonomous Networks\n\n[Barcelona, Spain, February 27, 2024] At MWC Barcelona 2024, on February 27, international industry association TM Forum held their Autonomous Networks Summit 2024 themed \"Autonomous Networks L4 is Coming\". Huawei's Board Member and President of ICT Products & Solutions Yang Chaobin delivered a keynote where he talked about \"Embracing the Intelligent Era with Highly Autonomous Networks\".\n\nYang Chaobin delivering a keynote\n\nTM Forum proposed the concept of autonomous networks (AN) in 2019. In just four years, a solid consensus has been reached on AN as the way forward for automation and intelligence. With a few leading operators already having achieved L3 autonomy in key scenarios, the value of AN is becoming increasingly clear. Yang said: \"The upgrade from L3 to L4 will accelerate value creation. It will reshape interaction models to change how O&M is performed, reshape the system capabilities that improve O&M efficiency, reshape the service processes that improve operations efficiency, and reshape integration models to shorten service TTM. This will help operators achieve their strategic goal of L4 autonomy.\"\n\nBreakthroughs in key technologies are the foundation for enhanced value creation with L4 autonomy, he went on to explain. \"Telecom foundation models are a key technology that enables autonomous network upgrades from L3 to L4 autonomy. The Huawei Telecom Foundation Model provides role-based copilots and scenario-based agents that help operators empower employees and improve user satisfaction.\"\n\nAt the event, Yang also presented their Net Master offering, an example of the foundation model's applications.

    "body": "Bitcoin price rallied further toward $58,000. BTC is now consolidating gains and might soon attempt more gains toward the $60,000 resistance.\n\nBitcoin Price Faces Fresh Hurdle\n\nBitcoin price extended its rally above the $55,000 resistance zone. BTC gained bullish momentum after it broke the $55,500 and $56,000 resistance levels. There was also a spike above the $57,000 resistance zone.\n\nA new multi-week high is formed near $57,572 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $57,000 level, but the price is still above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $50,950 swing low to the $57,572 high.\n\nBitcoin is now trading above $56,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. Immediate resistance is near the $57,200 level. The next key resistance could be $57,500.\n\nThere is also a rising channel forming with resistance near $57,650 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair, above which the price could rise toward the $58,000 resistance zone. If the bulls remain in action, the price could even surpass $58,000 and test $58,800. The main hurdle for them is visible near the $60,000 zone.\n\nAre Dips Supported In BTC?\n\nIf Bitcoin fails to rise above the $57,500 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $56,800 level.\n\nThe first major support is $56,000. If there is a close below $56,000, the price could start a decent pullback toward the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $50,950 swing low to the $57,572 high at $54,250. Any more losses might send the price toward the $53,200 support zone.\n\nTechnical indicators:\n\nHourly MACD - The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) - The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs has reviewed its forecast for summer peak Brent Crude prices to $87 per barrel, up by $2 from earlier expectations, citing land inventory drawdowns due to seaborne trade disruptions from the Red Sea crisis.\n\n\"OECD commercial stocks on land have drawn somewhat faster than expected as the redirection of flows away from the Red Sea has increased inventories on water,\" analysts at the investment bank wrote.\n\nAccording to Goldman, the international benchmark Brent Crude will likely remain in the $70-$90 a barrel trading range in the near term amid modest geopolitical premium from the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nThe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC+) has higher spare capacity now, which would help it mitigate any real disruptions to supply in most scenarios, the bank's analysts say.\n\nMoreover, non-OPEC+ supply is set to keep pace with expected solid growth in global oil consumption this year, Goldman Sachs notes.\n\nThe Wall Street bank expects the OPEC+ alliance to decide in early March to roll over the first-quarter cuts into the second quarter, and only gradually to unwind the supply reductions beginning in the third quarter of this year.\n\nOil industry watchers and analysts are also betting on OPEC+ extending its oil production cuts beyond the first quarter of 2024 into the next quarter, a new Bloomberg survey revealed.\n\nGoldman Sachs expects Brent prices to average around $80 a barrel in 2025 and doesn't see as likely that the price could drop below $70 for a sustained period of time.\n\nLast week, analysts at Deutsche Bank said that a nearly balanced market in the first half of the year and seasonal strengthening of demand in the second half are set to push the price of Brent Crude To $88 per barrel by the end of 2024.\n\n\"We look for continued OPEC+ discipline in a nearly balanced market for H1, and seasonal strength in H2,\" the bank's strategists wrote in a note last week carried by FXStreet.",

    "body": "President Bola Tinubu has said the decision to remove petroleum subsidy was a challenging one, but a necessary step to secure long term energy security and foster economic growth for the country.\n\nThe president said this while officially opening the 7th edition of the Nigeria International Energy Summit (NIES 2024) at the State Banquet Hall, Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe summit has as its theme, \"Navigating the New Energy World Order: Security, Transition, and Finance.\"\n\nTinubu said to mitigate short-term effects of petroleum subsidy removal on the vulnerable population, his administration was committed to implementing social intervention programmes.\n\nTinubu, represented by the minister of Information and National Orientation, Mohammed Idris Malagi, said the petroleum subsidy had over the years strained Nigeria's economic resources.\n\nThis, he said, led to inefficiencies and hindered investment in critical areas of energy security.\n\n\"By removing the subsidy, we are creating a more transparent and accountable energy sector.\n\n\"The funds that were previously allocated to subsidising petroleum products are now redirected towards developing and upgrading our energy and other social infrastructure.\n\n\"Furthermore, subsidy removal has encouraged further private sector participation in the energy industry with potential of attracting more local and international investors, innovation and competition in the sector.\n\n\"I am very aware of the immediate impact this decision may have had on our citizens, especially those with lower incomes.\n\n\"Therefore, in parallel with the subsidy removal, my administration is committed to implementing social intervention programmes to mitigate the short-term effects on vulnerable populations,\" he said.\n\nThese programmes, he said, would ensure that the burden of the subsidy removal was shared equitably and that the most vulnerable Nigerians were protected.\n\nThe president thanked the organisers of the summit for the opportunity to once again address the subsidy removal, which he said was a crucial issue that had been in the forefront of Nigeria's national discourse.\n\n\"Our great nation has long been dependent on the revenue generated from oil exports, and as we stand at the crossroads of the 21st century, it is imperative that we re-evaluate our energy policies to ensure a sustainable future,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he urged all stakeholders, including industry experts, policymakers and the general public to engage in constructive dialogue and collaboration, while navigating these challenging but transformative times.\n\nHe thanked everyone who contributed to the success of the summit, adding that it reflected a shared commitment to addressing the challenges and opportunities ahead in the dynamic and ever-evolving world of energy.\n\n\"This marks the first edition of NIES during my administration, and I am honoured to stand before you as we collectively chart a course for the sustainable and secure energy future of Nigeria.\n\n\"Energy security, as we know, is of paramount importance. It is not just a national concern; it is a global imperative.\n\n\"In the face of emerging challenges, both geopolitical and technological, we must ensure the resilience of our energy infrastructure.\n\n\"The decisions we make today will impact the energy security of generations to come,\" he added.\n\nHe emphasised leveraging innovation and collaboration to ensure a smooth and just transition that would leave no one behind.\n\n\"As a nation, we must explore innovative financing models, engage with the private sector, and attract investments that will propel us towards a more resilient and diversified energy sector,\" he said.\n\nThe summit is holding from Feb. 26 to March 1, and has in attendance more than 6,000 foreign and local oil and gas industry players, regulators and investors.",

    "body": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A rocket exploded late Tuesday night off the side of a ship traveling through the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, authorities said, the latest suspected attack to be carried out by Yemen's Houthi rebels.\n\nThe attack comes as the Houthis continue a series of assaults at sea over Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as the U.S. and its allies launch airstrikes trying to stop them.\n\nThe British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which oversees shipping in the Mideast, reported the attack happened about 70 miles off the coast of the Houthi-held port city of Hodeida. The rocket exploded several miles off the bow of the vessel, it said.\n\n\"The crew and vessel are reported to be safe and are proceeding to next port of call,\" the UKMTO said.\n\nThe private security firm Ambrey reported that the vessel targeted appeared to be a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier in the area at the time. Another ship, a Panama-flagged, Emirati-owned chemical tanker was nearby as well, Ambrey said.\n\nThe Associated Press could not immediately identify the vessels involved.\n\nThe Houthis typically take several hours to claim their assaults and have not yet done so for the assault late Tuesday.\n\nSince November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea and surrounding waters over the Israel-Hamas war. Those vessels have included at least one with cargo for Iran, the Houthis' main benefactor, and an aid ship later bound for Houthi-controlled territory.\n\nDespite over a month of U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi rebels remain capable of launching significant attacks. Last week, they severely damaged a ship in a crucial strait and downed an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars. The Houthis insist their attacks will continue until Israel stops its combat operations in the Gaza Strip, which have enraged the wider Arab world and seen the Houthis gain international recognition.\n\nThe Houthis, a Zaydi Shiite group, seized Yemen's capital in 2014 and have battled a Saudi-led coalition since 2015. Their Zaydi people ran a 1,000-year kingdom in Yemen up until 1962.",

    "body": "Bahrain has achieved impressive results on the first edition of the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Future of Growth Report 2024, performing exceptionally well across several indices, placing higher than the global average scores for talent availability (above 66) and for digital and technology talent (above 67) under the talent ecosystem category.\n\nThe report aims to provide an overview of growth trends and re-evaluate traditional global economic growth metrics, introducing a new multidimensional framework to assess the quality of economic growth across 107 countries around the world, grounded across four pillars to qualify traditional measures of growth: innovativeness, inclusiveness, sustainability, and resilience.\n\nThe Future of Growth Report 2024, which highlights seven distinct growth models to offer potential policy inspiration and enable the development of more holistic areas of improvement to capture common synergies through data analysis, ranked Bahrain second in the Gulf in the GDP per capita growth rate.\n\nMoreover, on the resilience pillar, Bahrain exhibited a robust performance on human capital indicators owing to a young population (90.1), the ability to fill vacancies with a global workforce (75.6) and investment in reskilling talent (70.2) - all well above global average scores.\n\nBahrain also scored above average in infrastructure quality, financial system resilience, technology supply concentration, and government adaptation on an institutional level.\n\nThe strategically located island nation also earned above global average scores under the financial ecosystem for digital payments and long term, venture, and SME finance availability. As for the technology ecosystem category, Bahrain placed just above the global average in business culture and competition, outshining its global counterparts in exports of advanced services, landing the maximum possible score of 100.\n\nFor the 'inclusiveness' pillar, Bahrain ranked above average in the inclusion in workforce category, and well above average in terms of access to financial services.\n\nNada AlSaeed, Chief of Strategy at Bahrain Economic Development Board, said: \"Bahrain's exceptional performance, particularly across pivotal categories of innovativeness and resilience, cements the island nation's reputation as a destination for talent and progressive government frameworks, reflected in the above average scores across the metrics of regulatory quality, human capital, and institutional policy vision.\"\n\n\"With its business-friendly environment that embraces the continual adoption of forward-thinking policies and agile regulation, and ongoing investment in its human capital, Bahrain continues to reach new heights on an international playing field, positioning the island nation as a frontrunner to global investors seeking to establish a new footprint in the region,\" the Chief of Strategy added.\n\nThe optimistic rankings on the Future of Growth Report 2024 come on the heels of Bahrain Delegation's successful participation at the 2024 World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting, which convened mid-January under the theme of Rebuilding Trust, bringing together global leaders and experts to exchange innovative ideas and develop strategies for economic progress. - TradeArabia News Service\n\nCopyright 2022 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Billions of dollars are at stake with days remaining in this year's Legislative session. Lawmakers are scrambling before the session ends March 7 to finalize statewide supplemental budgets that feature new investments in everything from curbing the opioid crisis to electric ferries. But initiatives expected for the November ballot could strip a total of more than $2.1 billion from the bottom line.

This means that overall emissions - including Scope 1, 2 and 3 - need to fall by around seven per cent up to 2030,\" the GSMA, which represents the interests of mobile operators around the world, said.\n\n\"Recent progress shows that this is possible, as the target reduction rate has been exceeded over the past three years for operational emissions in Europe, North America, Latin America and MENA (Middle East and North Africa).\" The report notes, \"improved data and further analysis are needed to better understand 'Scope 3' trends, which relate to emissions from operators' supply chains.\"\n\nAccording to the analysis, \"operational emissions fell despite surging demand for data and connectivity - the number of mobile connections globally rose by seven per cent between 2019-2022, while internet traffic more than doubled. The industry's carbon reductions were largely driven by strong progress on energy efficiency and use of renewable energy.\"\n\nCommenting on the findings, John Giusti, chief regulatory officer at the GSMA, said, \"the evidence shows that the mobile industry's commitment to net zero by 2050 is paying off. Despite surging demand for connectivity and data, the global carbon emissions of operators continued to fall.\n\n\"Although we see the strongest early lead from Europe in the race to net zero, and encouraging progress in the Americas and MENA, this is a race that everybody needs to win - or else we all lose. We see what is possible where there is a focus on energy efficiency and access to renewables.\"\n\nIn other GSMA news from Barcelona, the organization provided an update on its GSMA Open Gateway, an initiative composed of a a framework of universal network application programming interfaces (APIs) launched last year at MWC 2023 that is designed to unlock what was described at the time as the \"full potential of 5G networks.\"\n\nTwenty-one mobile network operators joined initially, and since then that number has more than doubled. \"Forty-seven mobile operator groups, representing 239 mobile networks and 65 per cent of connections around the world, have now signed up to the initiative,\" a release said. \"GSMA Open Gateway is focused on accelerating the growth of digital services and apps, by ensuring they integrate seamlessly with hundreds of participating networks around the world.\"\n\nWorking with technology partners and cloud providers, including AWS, Infobip, Microsoft, Nokia, and Vonage, more than 40 mobile operator networks have now made a combined total of 94 APIs commercially available to enterprise developers in 21 markets across Asia-Pacific, Africa, Europe, the Middle East and the Americas, the GSMA said.\n\nWith online fraud and cybercrime being one of the biggest issues facing online commerce, the GSMA, mobile operators, and technology partners are first focusing the GSMA Open Gateway initiative on tackling online crime.\n\nRecent activities, the GSMA said, include:\n\nGSMA director general Mats Granryd said that the organization's \"collective job for 2024 is to nurture and grow this opportunity and provide ubiquitous access to enterprise developers and cloud providers, so they can do what they do best, which is launch game-changing new services that can maximize the benefits of 5G networks.\"\n\nThe GSMA release went on to say, \"according to research by McKinsey, GSMA Open Gateway and other network API initiatives can unlock significant value for the telecommunications industry, and businesses using 5G networks over the next six years.\n\n\"It's forecast that, if operators can expose more of their network APIs and innovations to enterprise developer and cloud provider communities, then they can unlock an additional US$300 billion market opportunity by 2030.\"",

    "body": "While they are very different companies, both firms regularly turn in blockbuster earnings reports and forward guidance.\n\nA vegan makeup brand that makes products like facial putty has outperformed the king of AI over the past five years.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty has seen its stock rise 2,639% since early 2019, outpacing Nvidia's 1,937% return over the same period, Bespoke Investment Group pointed out in a research note on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the two companies are very different, they have one big thing in common: regularly turning in outstanding earnings reports, said Bespoke.\n\nGiven the moniker \"earnings triple plays,\" both companies usually beat analyst earnings-per-share estimates, beat consensus revenue forecasts, and raise forward guidance.\n\nBespoke highlighted that E.l.f. Beauty has turned in seven triple plays in a row, dating back to August 2022, beating Nvidia, which has seen five straight.\n\nE.l.f.'s strong performance can be partially explained by their savvy marketing on social media platforms like TikTok, Roblox, and Twitch, Business Insider's Lauren Johnson wrote in November 2023. Meanwhile, Nvidia has gotten an immense boost from the recent AI boom that some experts are calling a return to the Roaring 20s.\n\nTo be sure, comparing historical returns is not an exact science, as E.l.f.'s stock was trading around $8.50 at the start of February 2019, while Nvidia was at about $36 per share. The lower starting price means any subsequent gains are reflected by comparatively inflated percentage returns.",

    "title": "Russian security chief meets with Castro, vows 'comprehensive support' to allies in Latin America",
    "body": "Russia's top security official and Vladimir Putin ally Nikolai Patrushev promised \"comprehensive support\" to Russian allies in Latin America against U.S. \"interference\" during a meeting with officials from Cuba, Venezuela, Bolivia and Nicaragua, hosted in Managua on Tuesday.\n\n\"You are well aware of the aggressive methods of the United States of forcibly breaking down governments that do not suit them, political pressure and economic containment of states demonstrating independence,\" Russian Security Council Secretary Patrushev was quoted saying in a report by Russia's official newspaper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta.\n\nThe presence of intelligence officials in Russian delegations abroad is rarely disclosed by the country's state media. But the newspaper reported that Patrushev traveled with officials from Russian spy agencies like the Federal Security Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service in addition to officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and other government agencies.\n\nPictures from Russian media outlets show Cuban Interior Minister Lázaro Alberto Álvarez Casas attended the meeting.\n\nAt a time when Russia faces increasing isolation over its invasion of Ukraine, Patrushev said Latin America, a region traditionally thought as closer to the United States, is gaining \"growing importance\" for Russia, the report says. His trip to Latin America, which included a Monday stop in Cuba, happened just days after Russia's foreign minister met with Cuban and Venezuelan leaders on his way to attend a G-20 meeting in Brazil.\n\nPatrushev said Moscow is ready to provide \"full, comprehensive support to our Latin American friends, including preventing interference in the internal affairs of countries friendly to us, discrediting their legitimate authorities, intimidating the population, and destabilizing the economy.\"\n\nThe official hinted Russia's support is critical at a time when some of these countries are headed to elections, in reference to Venezuela, where strongman Nicolás Maduro has stepped back from efforts to improve relations with the United States and has broken commitments his government made to the opposition in a deal negotiated with U.S. support.\n\nPatrushev is expected to meet Nicaraguan authoritarian leader Daniel Ortega and his wife and vice president, Rosario Murillo, on Wednesday.\n\nBut first, Patrushev landed in Cuba on Monday, where he held a private meeting with retired Gen. Raul Castro to discuss \"issues of practical cooperation between Russia and Cuba in the field of security,\" according to Rossiyskaya Gazeta, reinforcing views that despite being out of office, the 92-year old revolutionary leader is still making important military and political decisions.\n\nThe report noted that Castro was \"cheerful and energetic\" and joked with Patrushev, whom he called \"my old friend.\"\n\nIn a separate meeting, the Russian senior official also discussed security issues and economic cooperation with the country's handpicked president, Miguel Díaz-Canel.\n\nIn recent years, Russia and Cuba have strengthened military and diplomatic ties, and since Russia's invasion of Ukraine the pace of the exchanges has dramatically increased, a development that has irritated the U.S. government. Patrushev previously traveled to Cuba in 2019 and in March of last year.\n\nThe communist government is also trying to attract Russian investments and credits to try to salvage the island's moribund socialist economy. But Russian officials have urged the government to speed up its own market reforms.\n\nIn Díaz-Canel's talks with the Russian top adviser, Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported that the Cuban leader praised Putin's recent interview with former Fox host Tucker Carlson, an hours-long exchange in which the Russian leader tried to provide historical justifications for his invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDíaz-Canel said the interview showed Putin's \"undeniable leadership in the world.\"\n\n_________",

It's worth noting all Australian-specification models will exclusively be sourced from the Chinese factory.\n\nProduction of the Polestar 3, along with the related Volvo EX90, had previously been pushed back a number of times due to needing more time for final software development and testing.\n\nStream Supercars and more motorsport action live and free on 7plus\n\nBoth electric SUVs were originally intended to go into production during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAlthough 2024 model year (MY24) examples of the Polestar 4 haven't reached Australia yet, pricing and specifications for MY25 examples appeared online late last year.\n\nThe information, first published by industry guide Redbook, shows tweaked pricing for MY25 Polestar 3 models.\n\nThe entry-level Long range Dual motor will start at $132,720 before on-roads, which is $180 less than MY24 pricing.\n\nSpec changes are yet to be confirmed, though Redbook's spec sheets reveal the base model will gain active noise cancellation but lose rear privacy glass.\n\nPolestar has previously confirmed the MY24 Polestar 3 will launch with the Plus pack and Pilot pack fitted as standard.\n\nIt has confirmed the Plus pack moves to the options list for MY25, but the Pilot pack remains standard fit and a mysterious Pro pack is available for $3200. It's unclear what the latter includes.\n\nThe Pilot pack in MY24 vehicles features a head-up display, Pilot Assist, and Park Assist Pilot.\n\nThe Plus pack, in contrast, includes the following:\n\nAs on the MY24, there will continue to be a separate Pilot Pack with LiDAR that costs $7500 and adds:\n\nThe Polestar 3 is a sportier, two-row cousin to the upcoming three-row Volvo EX90.\n\nIt has a rear-biased all-wheel drive system with dual electric motors, producing total system outputs of 360kW of power and 840Nm of torque. The 0-100km/h time is a claimed 5.0 seconds.\n\nThe optional Performance Pack bumps these outputs to 380kW and 910Nm, reducing the 0-100km/h time to 4.7 seconds.\n\nThe Polestar 3 uses a liquid-cooled 111kWh lithium-ion battery (107kWh useable) with nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry.\n\nThe company touts a preliminary WLTP range figure of 610km, or up to 560km with the Performance Pack.\n\nAll prices exclude on-road costs, Luxury Car Tax and GST.",

    "title": "Asian stocks muted as rate anxiety persists; Japan falls from record highs By Investing.com",
    "body": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks kept to a tight range on Wednesday amid persistent caution over higher-for-longer U.S. interest rates, with Japanese indexes pulling back from record highs as a tech-driven rally cooled.\n\nRegional markets took a middling lead-in from Wall Street, as caution ahead of key PCE price index data- the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge- remained largely in play.\n\nThe reading is due on Thursday, and comes amid repeated warnings from Fed officials that sticky inflation will keep rates higher for longer. U.S. stock futures were mildly negative in Asian trade.\n\nHigher-for-longer rates bode more near-term pressure for Asian stocks.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.3% on Wednesday, while the broader TOPIX lost 0.3% as both indexes retreated from record highs hit in the prior session.\n\nInvestors were encouraged to lock-in recent profits by souring risk appetite across the globe, while a recent, hotter-than-expected reading on Japanese inflation spurred increased speculation over the Bank of Japan.\n\nSticky inflation could push the BOJ into raising interest rates by as soon as April, bringing an end to the ultra-dovish, low interest rate regime enjoyed by Japanese markets for nearly a decade.\n\nChina's Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite index curbed early gains and traded in a flat-to-low range, amid increased anxiety over the country's beleaguered property market.\n\nEmbattled developer Country Garden Holdings (HK:2007) was hit with a liquidation petition in a Hong Kong court over its inability to repay a HK$1.6 billion ($200 million) loan.\n\nThe petition, whose first hearing is scheduled for mid-May, puts Country Garden squarely in the center of a deepening property crisis in China, as the sector struggles with worsening sales and a broader loss of faith among Chinese consumers.\n\nLosses in property and mainland stocks dragged Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 0.5%.\n\nBroader Asian markets were muted, with caution over U.S. interest rates limiting any major buying.\n\nAustralia's ASX 200 was flat as data showed consumer price index (CPI) inflation remained steady in January from the prior month. But the reading, along with core inflation, still remained well above the Reserve Bank's target range, heralding little change to the bank's hawkish outlook.\n\nFutures for India's Nifty 50 index pointed to a mildly positive open, with heavyweight tech stocks set to track small gains in their U.S. peers.\n\nSouth Korea's KOSPI was among the better performers for the day, rising 0.6% as it recovered from two straight days of losses.",

    "title": "Live Nation Can't Dismiss Shareholder Lawsuit Over 'False and Misleading' Earnings Reports, Judge Rules",
    "body": "A U.S. District Court judge is allowing a shareholder lawsuit against Live Nation to move forward, denying the concert promotion giant's motion to dismiss it in a decision handed down Friday (Feb. 27).\n\nThe case involves how much the company should have to disclose about ongoing public pressure from federal authorities and how much of its financial success it should attribute to its dominant market share in the concert industry -- as opposed to demand for concert tickets or the strength of its business.\n\nMore from Billboard\n\nShareholders Brian Donley and Gene Gress are suing Live Nation over drops in its share price from February 2022 to November 2023 that they say were brought on by the company's \"false and misleading statements and omissions\" within its annual earnings reports -- specifically regarding the company's alleged \"anticompetitive behavior and cooperation with regulators.\"\n\nThe lawsuit did not reveal any new antitrust allegations against Live Nation, nor did it detail any new antitrust investigations into the company by regulators. Attorneys for the shareholders instead focused on boilerplate language within the company's shareholder report and argued that it should have spent more time talking about the threat a federal antitrust investigation posed.\n\nIn siding with the shareholders, Judge Kenly Kiya Kato took issue with how the company described its success, noting in a 13-page ruling that she believed that Live Nation's \"failure to include specific facts and details about their presence and control of the live entertainment industry\" in its annual report didn't paint the full picture. Kato wrote in her ruling that the company's claim that 2022 revenue growth \"was a reflection of the quality of the Ticketmaster platform and its continued popularity with clients across the globe\" was \"misleading\" because it failed to mention that \"Ticketmaster controls ticket distribution for over 70% of major concert venues,\" and \"77% of the top 100 amphitheaters worldwide.\"\n\nKato also wrote that Ticketmaster's claims that its success was based on the superiority of its ticketing systems was in part a false claim because it omitted criticism from competitors who testified against the company in front of the U.S. Senate in early 2023.\n\nSince it merged with Ticketmaster in 2010, Live Nation has faced antitrust complaints over the company's size and market share from competitors, politicians including Senators Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal, and consumer advocates. Scrutiny of the company increased in 2019 when officials with the Department of Justice opted to extend a decade-old consent decree against it, and then ramped up again following the high-profile 2022 crash of Taylor Swift's Ticketmaster sale for her Eras Tour.\n\nSince 2022, Live Nation has not been notified that it's the subject of any legal action by the Department of Justice and has written in its annual disclosures that it cooperates with all federal and state authorities, operates in a highly competitive marketplace and attributes its revenue growth at the end of 2021 to an increase \"in events and higher ticket sales.\"\n\nAttorney Laurence M. Rosen, representing several shareholders in the class action lawsuit, said Live Nation's answers contradict June 2023 reports from Politico and CNBC that the company was \"allegedly stonewalling\" a Senate subcommittee led by Senator Blumenthal that was seeking documents from the company about how it operated its concerts division.\n\nLive Nation countered that Blumenthal was misrepresenting the dispute, that it had already handed over thousands of documents and was contesting demands for confidential information that included private details about how much artists earned from touring. In its response to the Senate committee, the company argued it would only hand over the documents if confidentiality protections were put in place. While Live Nation's attorneys viewed the disagreement as insignificant, Rosen argued that the objection meant the company was \"not cooperating fully with the ongoing DOJ and Senate Subcommittee investigations,\" an attorney for the shareholders wrote.",

    "body": "By Ankur Banerjee\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian stocks were tentative on Wednesday ahead of a U.S. inflation reading this week that could influence the timing of the Federal Reserve's easing cycle, while the New Zealand dollar fell sharply after the central bank softened its hawkish stance on rates.\n\nNew Zealand's central bank held the cash rate steady at 5.5% on Wednesday, reiterating that previous rate hikes had helped dampen prices, but adding that the risk of further rate hikes had been reduced. The kiwi was last at $0.61235, down 0.75% on the day.\n\n\"The RBNZ has closed the door to further rate hikes, which was a surprise to somewhat hawkish expectations,\" said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo.\n\n\"This may give room for NZD longs to unwind in the short term, but NZD still provides a strong carry in this low volatility environment.\"\n\nThe yen remained bolted to psychologically key 150 per dollar level and was last at 150.43 per dollar. The Nikkei was 0.2% lower on the day, having touched fresh record peaks this week.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.11% lower at 527.14 points but hovering around a near seven-month peak of 531.56.\n\nChina stocks were mixed in early trading, with Hong Kong' Hang Seng index down 0.31% and China's blue-chip index CSI300 up 0.46%.\n\nInvestor focus is squarely on the personal consumption expenditures price index (PCE) for January, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, due on Thursday. The PCE is expected to have risen 0.3% on a monthly basis in January, up slightly from the 0.2% increase seen in December, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nA slew of strong economic data along with inflation that has proven to be sticky has resulted in traders drastically dialling back their initial expectations of deep and early interest rate cuts from the Fed.\n\nMarkets now anticipate June to be the starting point of the easing cycle compared with March at the start of the year. Traders now expect 77 basis points of cuts this year versus pricing in 150 bps of easing at the start of the year.\n\nYuting Shao, macro strategist at State Street Global Markets, said individual data releases carry weight for a data-dependent Fed and will impact risk sentiment given the near-neutral positioning from investors.\n\n\"Although one data point does not make a trend, latest inflation and employment readings have raised the prospect that perhaps no landing scenario is driving many asset markets.\"\n\nOther data due this week which could help shape expectations from the Fed include the second estimate of gross domestic product, jobless claims and manufacturing activity.\n\nFed policymakers have also in recent days pushed back against cutting rates too early, with Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman on Tuesday saying she was in no rush to cut U.S. interest rates, particularly given upside risks to inflation that could stall progress or even cause a resurgence of price pressures.\n\nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar wobbled a bit in early trading after data showed consumer price inflation held at a two-year low in January, reinforcing market expectations interest rates would not need to increase any further. The Aussie was 0.11% lower at $0.6537.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, rose 0.01%.\n\nU.S. crude fell 0.41% to $78.55 per barrel and Brent was at $83.31, down 0.41% on the day, as the prospect of a delayed U.S. rate cutting cycle offset the boost provided by talk of extensions to production cuts from OPEC+. [O/R]\n\nSpot gold rose 0.1% to $2,030.83 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

    "body": "Founded in March 2023, Moonshot AI is among the better-known startups developing generative artificial intelligence in China, hoping to eventually match the likes of OpenAI and Google.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. led the largest single financing round for a Chinese artificial intelligence startup, the latest in a string of sizeable investments that suggest the e-commerce firm is again deploying capital in the hunt for growth.\n\nAlibaba joins Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Silicon Valley peers like Microsoft Corp. in placing big bets on generative AI, the technology that powers ChatGPT.\n\nIt led a $1 billion funding round in Moonshot AI with existing backer Monolith Management, boosting the year-old firm's valuation eight-fold to some $2.5 billion, people familiar with the deal said.\n\nThey joined previous backers including the investment arm of food delivery giant Meituan and Hongshan, formerly Sequoia China, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a private transaction.\n\nFounded in March 2023, Moonshot AI is among the better-known startups developing generative artificial intelligence in China, hoping to eventually match the likes of OpenAI and Google.\n\nIt rolled out its Kimi chatbot to the public last November and has since launched a platform for developers to build AI applications atop its model. Its valuation stood at just $300 million when it secured initial funding.\n\nMoonshot AI declined to comment on the company's fundraising details, which were first reported by local media including 36kr. Monolith confirmed its participation in the latest round, without details. Alibaba representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlibaba's new chiefs, Joseph Tsai and Eddie Wu, have pledged to turn around a flagging company hammered by two years of regulatory scrutiny and an economic downturn. It's driving new investment into game-changing technologies such as AI, while orchestrating a complicated multi-way split that will bring business lines from cloud to logistics to the fore.\n\nTsai has said the cloud unit now hosts half of China's generative AI firms and serves about 80% of the country's technology companies.\n\nBut they're getting into a field that's getting crowded, as venture capital firms and tech leaders pour billions into training and developing AI services, mirroring a wave of activity across Silicon Valley and Europe. Other Chinese AI startups raising significant amounts from investors included Baichuan and Zhipu.\n\nThat's despite lingering concerns about US sanctions, which bar Chinese firms from buying the most powerful Nvidia Corp. chips used to train and run AI models. Washington has targeted China's AI efforts because the technology has geopolitical and military applications, complicating an already tense relationship.\n\nAlibaba previously joined a $300 million-plus round for Zhipu in 2023 alongside longtime rival Tencent. The company is trying to revive the cloud business and integrate AI and its inhouse model -- Tongyi Qianwen -- across a sprawling business that also spans entertainment.\n\nSource: Bloomberg",

    "body": "The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Poised For 10% Correction After Hitting This level appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News\n\nBitcoin has again shown its resilience and upward momentum, surpassing the $55,000 mark following a breakout from a 10-day accumulation range. This milestone, achieved for the first time since November 2021's all-time high, marks another record-setting moment in the cryptocurrency's journey.\n\nEthereum has joined the rally, surging by 26.6% since its cycle low, while Bitcoin has recorded a staggering 256% gain from its cycle low.\n\nIn the wake of these game-changing price movements, investors wonder: what comes next? Analyst Jason Pizzino delves into the current market dynamics and potential resistance levels. Having closely monitored market trends for over 18 months, Pizzino offers details into these uncertain waters.\n\nHe said that sometimes big changes in the market happen slowly. For example, back in 2023, it took seven months for things to build up before a big breakthrough. Then, out of nowhere, Bitcoin's value shot up to $55,000 overnight, breaking through a barrier at $52,000. That $52,000 level came from a peak in 2021.\n\nAfter a quick rise in December 2021, Bitcoin hovered around $52,000 and dropped to $48,000 before things calmed down. Now, Bitcoin is back around those levels, aiming for even higher prices.\n\nHe also said that a big milestone everyone is watching is $60,000. But in the past, when Bitcoin tried to go past $60,000, it struggled and eventually dropped after reaching $65,000. This makes $60,000 a critical target.\n\nHe pointed out that hitting around $62,700 would be another important milestone. This number represents a doubling of the recent price increase from the low point during the crypto SEC issue in September to the peak during the ETF excitement in January, followed by a drop.\n\nOne key aspect Pizzino highlights is the performance of major indices like the S&P 500, which has shown positive gains for November, December, January, and February. Historically, such consecutive gains have often been followed by further upward momentum, with March typically maintaining positive trends about 80% of the time.",

    "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Heat waves are bearing down on four Australian states, as authorities battle a blaze in the nation's populous southeast that's burned homes and led to thousands of people being advised to leave the area.\n\nA catastrophic fire-danger rating -- the strongest warning -- has been declared for the Wimmera region, which encompasses 2.3 million hectares in Victoria state's west, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Several other districts in the state have been issued with an extreme warning, and temperatures are forecast to reach 40C (104F) or more. Total fire bans are in place across several cities, including Melbourne.\n\n\"The conditions are not favorable at all for us, they're pretty extreme in terms of the winds and the heat,\" Rick Nugent, Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner, said in an Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio interview Wednesday. \"The risk is that with the heat and the wind, that embers are blown forward and then start spot fires and then they start running again.\"\n\nA fire northwest of the regional Victorian city of Ballarat has been controlled but authorities are warning that it could breach containment lines. The fire has so far burned about 22,000 hectares of land and destroyed five homes.\n\nMore than 600 firefighters from Victoria and neighboring New South Wales state are working to contain the spread of the fire, the ABC reported. According to the Guardian, more than 30,000 Victorians have been urged to leave their homes.\n\nSome Australian regions have experienced record-breaking dry, hot conditions in recent months, prompting concerns of an elevated bushfire risk. Heat waves are also baking large parts of South Australia and Western Australia states as well as New South Wales, the country's most populous state. An extreme fire danger rating has been issued for seven districts in South Australia.\n\nRead: Wildfire's Toxic Legacy Leaves Children Gasping for Air Years Later\n\nAustralia has a troubled history with bushfires. Between July 2019 and March 2020, the so-called Black Summer fires raged across the nation's east, killing 33 people and consuming 24 million hectares of land -- an area roughly equivalent to half of California.",

    "body": "Tens of thousands of residents in Australia's southeast were told to evacuate on Wednesday due to an intense heatwave that authorities said could further spread a massive bushfire in Victoria state, which faces its worst conditions in four years.\n\nExtreme fire ratings have been issued for large parts of Victoria with the Wimmera region in the west given a catastrophic ranking, the top warning level. Mildura, a rural city of about 56,000, could touch 45 degree Celsius, the Bureau of Meteorology said.\n\nA potential fire impact zone that covers several rural towns has been identified as officials urged around 30,000 residents there to leave their homes by Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Today will be a very challenging day for firefighters,\" Jason Heffernan, Chief Officer at Victoria fire department told ABC television. \"Today is one of those days when communities may need to take immediate action at very short notice.\"\n\nHundreds of firefighters were still battling a massive blaze near the city of Ballarat, 95 km west of Melbourne. The fire, burning since last Thursday, has already destroyed six homes, killed livestock and burnt more than 20,000 hectares (200 square kilometers).\n\nA heat wave is set to sweep in from Australia's outback interior, moving across Victoria before likely shifting northeast to the state of New South Wales on Thursday. Total fire bans are in place across several cities, including Melbourne.\n\nDry lightning could spark new fires while strong winds forecast from Wednesday afternoon could spread the existing one near Ballarat, Heffernan said.\n\nHeffernan urged people to reconsider any decision to stay back to protect their homes.\n\n\"Unless your property is immaculately prepared and you have firefighting resources available and you are fit and you are mentally capable to sustain a long duration firefight ... my strong advice to the community is to leave early,\" he said.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2024.",

    "body": "Why does the US government think a Kroger-Albertsons merger would be bad for grocery shoppers?\n\nTwo of the biggest grocery chains in the United States had hoped to complete the largest supermarket merger in the country's history this year. But their plan to compete with big-box retailers by combining forces faces legal challenges that make it look far less likely. On Monday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed an administrative complaint against Kroger's $24.6 billion deal to acquire Albertsons. A federal lawsuit the agency filed with the attorneys general from eight states and the District of Columbia seeks to block the proposed merger. The FTC says it would result in store closures and higher prices for shoppers in places where the Albertsons and Kroger now compete.\n\nStarbucks and Workers United, long at odds, say they'll restart labor talks\n\nStarbucks and the union organizing its U.S. workers say they have agreed to begin talks with the aim of reaching labor agreements. The announcement was a breakthrough for the two sides, which have been at odds since Workers United first organized baristas at a Starbucks store in Buffalo, New York, in late 2021. Workers have voted to unionize at more than 370 company-owned Starbucks stores in the U.S., but none of those stores has reached a labor agreement with the company. In separate statements Tuesday, Starbucks and Workers United said they have a shared commitment to establishing a positive relationship with their workers.\n\nYellen urges world leaders to 'unlock' frozen Russian Central Bank assets and send them to Ukraine\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is offering her strongest public support yet for the idea of liquidating roughly $300 billion in frozen Russian Central Bank assets and using them for Ukraine's long-term reconstruction. The U.S. and its allies froze Russian foreign holdings in retaliation for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine two years ago. The assets have been sitting untapped as the war grinds on, while officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of sending the money to Ukraine. Yellen said ahead of a Group of 20 finance ministers meeting in Brazil on Tuesday that it is \"urgent\" for the leaders to find a way to unlock the assets and use them to support Ukraine.\n\nStock market today: Wall Street holds steady near record highs\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks held near their record levels after a quiet day of trading. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 96 points, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.4%. Macy's climbed after unveiling a restructuring plan, and Norwegian Cruise Line steamed higher on hopes for a stronger 2024. Chevron weighed on the Dow amid worries that its pending takeover of Hess may be facing a threat. Treasury yields were mixed in the bond market after a report showed that confidence among U.S. consumers unexpectedly weakened. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.30%.\n\nNigeria's union workers are on strike nationwide over soaring inflation and unmet promises\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigeria's government employees and other union workers have begun a new nationwide strike that threatens to shut down key services while people are angry about soaring inflation and growing economic pain. Since taking office last year, President Bola Tinubu has enacted policies that include doing away with fuel subsidies and unifying the country's multiple exchange rates. That led to a devaluation of the naira against the dollar. Gasoline prices have more than doubled and inflation reached close to 30% last month. That's the highest in nearly three decades, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nEPA awards $1 billion to clean up toxic waste in third cash infusion for Superfund program\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency says 25 toxic waste sites in 15 states will be cleaned up as part of a $1 billion infusion to the federal Superfund program. The money is the third and last installment in $3.5 billion allocated under the 2021 infrastructure law signed by President Joe Biden. It will help clear a backlog of hazardous sites such as old landfills, mines and manufacturing facilities targeted by the 44-year-old Superfund program. Sites slated for cleanup include a former smelting plant in East Helena, Montana; an old textile mill in Greenville, South Carolina; and a New Jersey beach area blighted by toxic material used to build a seawall and jetty nearly 60 years ago.\n\nConsumer confidence slips in February as anxiety over potential recession surprisingly reappears\n\nAmerican consumers are feeling less confident this month as concerns over a possible recession grew, despite most indicators pointing to a healthy U.S. economy. The Conference Board, a business research group, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell to 106.7 from a revised 110.9 in January. Analysts had been forecasting that the index remained steady from January to February. The index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The index measuring Americans short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell to 79.8 from 81.5 in January. A reading under 80 often signals an upcoming recession.\n\nUS and UK hit Iranian deputy commander and Houthi member with sanctions\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. and United Kingdom sanctioned a deputy commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and a Houthi militant member, Tuesday. Additionally, the U.S. sanctioned firms registered in Hong Kong and the Marshall Islands, along with two ships, including one that transported $100 million in Iranian commodities to China. The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with Americans.\n\nBurger chain Wendy's looking to test surge pricing at restaurants as early as next year\n\nWendy's is looking to test having the prices of its menu items fluctuate throughout the day based on demand, implementing a strategy that has already taken hold with ride-sharing companies and ticket sellers. During a conference call earlier this month, Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner said that the Dublin, Ohio-based burger chain will start testing dynamic pricing, also known as surge pricing, as early as next year. Wendy's also plans to invest about $20 million to launch digital menu boards at all of its U.S. company-run restaurants by the end of next year.\n\nBeyond Meat's shares soar on better-than-expected Q4 revenue despite weak US sales\n\nBeyond Meat's shares soared Tuesday after it reported higher-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter. The plant-based meat maker said its revenue for the October-December period fell 8% to $73.7 million. That was better than the $66.7 million Wall Street was expecting. Beyond Meat's shares jumped more than 78% in after-market trading. Beyond Meat said its U.S. sales fell 23.5% during the quarter. But the company said it's confident that a new, healthier version of its signature Beyond Burger will win back consumers. The new burger goes on sale in the U.S. this spring. The company's international sales were also strong, jumping 28.5% in the fourth quarter.",

    "title": "Odysseus moon lander still operational, in final hours before battery dies",
    "body": "Texas-based Intuitive Machines LUNR.O said in an online update on Tuesday that its control center in Houston remained in contact with the lander as it \"efficiently sent payload science data and imagery in furtherance of the company's mission objectives.\"\n\nThe spacecraft reached the lunar surface last Thursday after an 11th-hour navigational glitch and white-knuckle descent that ended with Odysseus landing in a sideways or sharply tilted position that has impeded its communications and solar-charging capability.\n\nIntuitive Machines said the next day that human error was to blame for the navigational issue. Flight readiness teams had neglected to manually unlock a safety switch before launch, preventing subsequent activation of the vehicle's laser-guided range finders and forcing flight engineers to hurriedly improvise an alternative during lunar orbit.\n\nAn Intuitive executive told Reuters on Saturday that the safety switch lapse stemmed from the company's decision to forgo a test-firing of the laser system during pre-launch checks in order to save time and money.\n\nWhether or not failure of the range finders and last-minute substitution of a work-around ultimately caused Odysseus to land in an off-kilter manner remained an open question, according to Intuitive officials.\n\nNevertheless, the company said last Friday that two of the spacecraft's communication antennae were knocked out of commission, pointed the wrong way, and that its solar panels were likewise facing the wrong direction, limiting the vehicle's ability to recharge its batteries.\n\nAs a consequence, Intuitive said on Monday that it expected to lose contact with Odysseus on Tuesday morning, cutting short the mission that held a dozen science instruments for NASA and several commercial customers and had been intended to operate on the moon for seven to 10 days.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Intuitive said controllers were still \"working on final determination of battery life on the lander, which may continue up to an additional 10-20 hours.\"\n\nThe latest update from the company indicated the spacecraft might last for a total of six days before the sun sets over the landing site.\n\nThe company's shares closed 7% higher on Tuesday. The stock plummeted last week following news the spacecraft had landed askew.\n\nIt remained to be seen how much research data and imagery from payloads might go uncollected because of Odysseus' cockeyed landing and shortened lunar lifespan.\n\nNASA paid Intuitive $118 million to build and fly Odysseus.\n\nNASA chief Bill Nelson told Reuters on Tuesday he understood that agency scientists expected to retrieve some data from all six of their payloads. He also said Odysseus apparently landed beside a crater wall and was leaning at a 12-degree angle, though it was not clear whether that meant 12 degrees from the surface or 12 degrees from an upright position.\n\nIntuitive executives said on Feb. 23 that engineers believed Odysseus had caught the foot of one of its landing legs on the lunar surface as it neared touchdown and tipped over before coming to rest horizontally, apparently propped up on a rock.\n\nNo photos from Odysseus on the lunar surface have been transmitted yet. But an image from an orbiting NASA spacecraft released on Monday showed the lander as a tiny speck near its intended destination in the moon's south pole region.\n\nDespite its less-than-ideal touchdown, Odysseus became the first U.S. spacecraft to land on the moon since NASA's last crewed Apollo mission to the lunar surface in 1972.\n\nIt was also the first lunar landing ever by a commercially manufactured and operated space vehicle, and the first under NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to Earth's natural satellite this decade.",
