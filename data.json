    "body": "This report is from today's CNBC Daily Open, our international markets newsletter. CNBC Daily Open brings investors up to speed on everything they need to know, no matter where they are. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nNikkei extends rally\n\nJapan'sNikkei 225 hit a fresh high Monday as trading resumed after a long weekend, while China markets were set to snap a nine-day winning run. The broader Topix also gained. Wall Street hit another record on Friday as markets wrapped the week on a positive note with help from Nvidia's bumper earnings. The S&P 500 gained 0.03% hitting fresh highs, while the Dow also closed at an all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.28% but touched a fresh 52-week high in the session.\n\nXiaomi's big EV bet\n\nChinese smartphone company Xiaomi is betting big on its new electric vehicle. The firm is putting a premium price on its first electric car, targeting around 20 million users, Group President Weibing Lu told CNBC. There are, however, doubts over Xiaomi's ability to sell the car, given its reputation as a maker of lower-priced products.\n\nSouth Korea market measures\n\nSouth Korea's financial regulatory body unveiled new measures to improve corporate governance on Monday. The move by the FSC underlined steps authorities were taking to boost valuations of stock markets in Asia's fourth-largest economy.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway earnings jump\n\nBerkshire Hathaway operating earnings surged 28% in the fourth quarter, while its cash pile soared to record levels. For the full year, operating earnings rose to $37.35 billion, up 17% from $30.85 billion in the previous year.\n\n[Pro] China AI stocks surge\n\nEven if China's broader market recovery remains muted, Chinese artificial intelligence stocks are rising. Analysts are bullish on tech giant Baidu -- which Morgan Stanley called the \"best AI play in China Internet.\" The company is set to release earnings this week.\n\nAl euphoria took over Wall Street last week, thanks to Nvidia.\n\nThe chipmaker's market cap briefly topped $2 trillion on Friday, after posting blockbuster earnings that fueled a powerful stock rally.\n\nAll three indexes rose more than 1% on the week, with both the Dow and S&P posting record closes.\n\nMarket watchers seem optimistic the current rally has legs since it's driven by strong earnings.\n\n\"I hope you're enjoying the party. Obviously, Nvidia was the grand finale for the earnings announcement season,\" said Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates last week.\n\n\"This is why earnings season is so important... things are good. This quarter this year is strongest since the late 1999.\"\n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether the AI momentum can last as inflation risks linger.\n\nInvestors, so far, have shrugged off the Fed's cautious tone on interest rates and focused on the AI fervor. But that could change as a big inflation data point is due this week that could spook Wall Street.\n\nThe personal-consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will be released Thursday. This comes on the heels of recent hot consumer and wholesale prices that delivered a one-two punch to markets.\n\nIf the PCE data surprises on the upside that could dampen the markets' bullish mood.",

    "title": "Nasdaq 100 Needs to Break Out Early This Week to Avoid a Top: Key Levels to Watch | Investing.com UK",
    "body": "Stocks finished the week higher following the Nvidia-led rally on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the Nasdaq 100 failed to advance and clear key technical resistance. This could be important this week, especially if the index fails to surpass resistance early, as the risks turn unfavorable as we move through the week.\n\nThis week will feature important economic data, including the PCE report on Thursday, and Friday will feature the ISM manufacturing report and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment and inflation expectations.\n\nWe will get new home sales and S&P Caselogic housing prices early in the week, with GDP revisions on Wednesday.\n\nIt will be a week filled with Treasury auctions, with the 2-year auction on Monday at 11:30 AM ET and the 5-year auction later that day at 1 PM ET. Then, on Tuesday, we also get the 7-year Treasury action at 1 PM ET.\n\nLast week, the 20-year and 30-year TIPS auctions were not strong, and both tailed.\n\nThe 20-year auction was particularly weak, with a bid-to-cover ratio down to 2.39% from 2.53% last month, while indirect acceptance rates plunged to 59.1% from 62.2%. That was the weakest indirect acceptance rate since June 2021.\n\nThe 5-year Treasury auction last month was fairly weak, with a low bid-to-cover ratio of 2.31% and a weak 60.9% indirect acceptance rate.\n\nSo this week's 5-year auction will be something to watch when it takes place. If the numbers come in weaker than last month, that will be a sign of weak demand and could lead to higher rates.\n\nWe need to worry about yields at this point, mostly because of where they are on the charts.\n\nThe 7-year Treasury for example has been trading around resistance at 4.36%, since the CPI report, and has been respecting that level of resistance.\n\nThe same example is happening across the curve; clearly, the market is waiting for something to determine whether rates should be higher.\n\nBut the last time the 7-year got above the 4.35% resistance level, the S&P 500 and NDX fell sharply in the third quarter, and when the 7-year went back below 4.35%, the stock indexes rebounded.\n\nSo this 4.35% level on the 7-year seems like an important spot, and this week seems like a week that we could see the 7-year break higher, especially with the auction and PCE report and the ISM data.\n\nThe diamond pattern on the NDX worked fairly nicely last week, I say fairly, because the breaking of the diamond took us down to the 78.6% retracement level, and then Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) results saved the day.\n\nHowever, even with the NDX gapping higher on Friday, it couldn't hold the gains and finished lower on the day, closing below resistance and the highs seen on February 9.\n\nThis sets up what could be a 2b topping pattern, and obviously, there needs to be confirmation of this pattern, and that confirmation only comes by moving lower and not surpassing the highs of Friday.\n\nThere is no reversal pattern if the Nasdaq can gap higher on Monday and take out that high seen on Friday. But as of the close on Friday, the opportunity for that 2b topping pattern appears to be in place.\n\nA sharp drop today would pretty much confirm it, and it could result in the NASDAQ dropping back 17,450 and erasing the gap opening from Thursday over this week.\n\nWhat did the Chicken say to the GPU? I don't know, but AI and Chicken Wing are in vogue. It seems that, for some reason, Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) and Nvidia's stocks have a lot in common these days.\n\nI'm not sure what exactly that is. Still, after trading inversely to one another for some time over the summer, both stocks finally got on the same page on October 30, and both Nvidia and Wingstop, the chicken wing restaurant, have been linked.\n\nMaybe the AI is helping throughput at the restaurants, or the chickens are helping build the GPUs. I'm not sure, but I find it odd that businesses on literally opposite sides of the spectrum that had an inverse relationship are now linked at the hip.\n\nNot only that, but both stocks have seen nearly the same gains in percentage terms since October 30, at nearly 90%.\n\nSure, Wingstop is expected to have some solid revenue and earnings growth over the next few years, and quarterly results were better than expected.\n\nBut I have also been doing this long enough to know that when things like this happen, there is something more going on that speaks to the mindset of the market and not so much the fundamentals of the market.\n\nWING is forecast to grow earnings by 19.5% in 2024 and revenue by 19.6% in 2024, while Nvidia is expected to grow earnings by 85% in fiscal 2025 and revenue by 76.8%, yet both trade for around 18 times sales.\n\nThey seem to have too many strange coincides for me.",

    "body": "SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell on Monday, extending losses from the previous session after the dollar rose on market views that higher-than-expected inflation could delay cuts to high U.S. interest rates that have been capping global fuel demand growth.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 14 cents, or 0.2%, to $81.48 a barrel by 0656 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) declined 22 cents, or 0.3%, to $76.27 a barrel as the U.S. dollar strengthened. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\nThe dip built on losses last week, when Brent declined about 2% and WTI fell more than 3% as markets pushed out the start of U.S. interest rate cuts by two months due to an uptick in inflation.\n\n\"The risk-on sentiment seems to be in a retreat after the Nvidia-led market rally last week as higher-for-longer rate expectations lifted the U.S. dollar, pressuring commodity prices,\" Auckland-based independent analyst Tina Teng said.\n\nOil prices have been trading between $70 and $90 a barrel since November, as rising supply in the U.S. and concerns of weak demand in China offset OPEC+ supply cuts despite two wars raging.\n\n\"Crude oil prices declined for want of fresh drivers,\" ANZ analysts wrote in a note. \"Oil has been caught between bullish factors such as lower OPEC output and elevated geopolitical risks and bearish concerns about weak demand in China.\"\n\nAs the Israel-Hamas conflict continues in the Middle East, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN on Sunday that negotiators for the United States, Egypt, Qatar and Israel had agreed on the basic contours of a hostage deal during talks in Paris but are still in negotiations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was not clear yet whether a deal would materialise.\n\nThe geopolitical risk premium from Yemeni Houthis' attacks on ships in the Red Sea remained modest at only a $2 a barrel boost to Brent, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.\n\nHowever, the bank has raised its summer peak price to $87 a barrel, up from $85, as Red Sea disruptions have driven larger-than-expected draws in stocks held by countries that are members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nGoldman Sachs still expects oil demand to grow by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024 but has cut China's forecast while raising that for the U.S. and India.\n\nSeparately, investors are keeing an eye on the impact on Russian oil supply after the United Staes sanctioned Moscow's leading tanker group Sovcomflot on Friday.\n\nAdding to global energy supplies, Qatar will further raise liquefied natural gas production despite a recent steep drop in global prices.\n\nIn the U.S., the ANZ analysts anticipated oil stockpiles could start to fall in the coming weeks as refineries return from maintenance, which could offer some support to prices.\n\nU.S. energy firms this week added the most oil rigs since November, and the most in a month since October 2022, energy services firm Baker Hughes said. - Reuters",

    "body": "US singer Taylor Swift will perform six sold-out concerts in Singapore as part of her Eras World Tour from March 2-9 - Copyright AFP DAVID GRAY\n\nThe \"Swift effect\" is about to hit Southeast Asia but Singapore has left some of its neighbours seeing red while it profits from a Taylor-made tourism boom as the star's only stop in the region.\n\nMore than 300,000 fans from the city-state and neighbouring countries will attend the US superstar's six sold-out Eras Tour shows at the National Stadium from March 2-9.\n\nIngrid Delgado, a fresh graduate in Manila who is travelling to Singapore for the March 4 show, said she bought a \"new shimmering dress\" for the occasion but had trouble finding an affordable hotel.\n\n\"A lot were booked already, so I had to book a more expensive hotel,\" she said.\n\nThe Fullerton Hotels and Resorts, as well as the Fairmont Hotel, told AFP that demand for rooms during the concert period had risen.\n\nBig spenders have taken up Marina Bay Sands' luxury packages named after Swift's hit songs, such as \"Shake it Off\" and \"Stay Stay Stay\".\n\nThe hotel's SG$50,000 ($37,230) \"Wildest Dreams\" package includes VIP tickets, fine dining, a hotel suite, limousine transfers and passes to tourist attractions.\n\nThe hotel told AFP all its packages were sold out.\n\nSingapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines said there had been increased demand for Singapore-bound flights but could not say whether it was solely due to the \"Swift Effect\".\n\nA large contingent of Malaysian Swifties will be crossing into neighbouring Singapore.\n\n\"It's a dream come true. I feel excited and nervous,\" said Harith Arsat, a 20-year-old student who will be making his first overseas trip from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn the Philippines, budget carrier Cebu Pacific has changed its usual flight number for Singapore-bound planes to \"1989\" -- the year Swift was born and the title of her fifth album -- for the March 1-9 period.\n\n- Red carpet -\n\nHowever, not everyone was happy when Swift's only Southeast Asia stop was announced, including fans and governments in some of Singapore's neighbours.\n\nTravelling to Singapore is expensive for many in the region due to high currency exchanges, to say nothing of ritzy hotel packages.\n\nSome were also unhappy because Singapore provided a grant to help secure Swift's record-breaking tour for the city-state.\n\nOfficials from the culture ministry and Singapore Tourism Board, citing business confidentiality, declined to say last week how much was paid, or whether an exclusivity deal had been signed to make Singapore Swift's sole Southeast Asian stop.\n\nThat followed reports that Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin had told a business forum in Bangkok that Singapore had indeed made such a deal.\n\nThe Singapore officials did not address Srettha's comments directly but said Swift's shows were \"likely to generate significant benefits to the Singapore economy\".\n\nSingapore has been rolling out the red carpet for many international artists, such as Blackpink, Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, since ending its Covid-19 pandemic curbs.\n\nColdplay performed six sold-out shows in January and upcoming acts include Bruno Mars, Sum 41 and Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n\"Singapore started to open faster than others after the pandemic and its first-mover advantage and concerted efforts to bring in acts, events and conventions has helped,\" Song Seng Wun, economic adviser for CGS International, told AFP.\n\nMillions scrambled for tickets when they went on sale last year, which led to a rise in online scams targeting desperate Swifties.\n\nSingapore police even released a social media video with the tagline: \"Don't lose money swiftly, buy your tickets safely.\"\n\nRegardless of the dangers, Ericko Dimas Pamungkas, 25, in Jakarta logged in to three devices to get a ticket queue number.\n\n\"I got very lucky. I feel like this concert is one of the most important moments for me,\" he said.\n\nSwift has evolved from a singer with relatable lyrics into a canny businesswoman and the world's biggest pop star, and fans believe there is plenty to learn from the 34-year-old.\n\n\"I appreciate Taylor's candidness and what she stands for such as rights, generosity and compassion,\" said Spencer Ler, a Singaporean pilot who queued for 22 hours to get tickets for his daughter and her friends.",

Obviously, Nvidia was the grand finale for the earnings announcement season,\" said Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates last week.\n\n\"This is why earnings season is so important... things are good. This quarter this year is strongest since the late 1999.\"\n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether the AI momentum can last as inflation risks linger.\n\nInvestors, so far, have shrugged off the Fed's cautious tone on interest rates and focused on the AI fervor. But that could change as a big inflation data point is due this week that could spook Wall Street.\n\nThe personal-consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will be released Thursday. This comes on the heels of recent hot consumer and wholesale prices that delivered a one-two punch to markets.\n\nIf the PCE data surprises on the upside that could dampen the markets' bullish mood.",

And the foods, flashlights, cell phones - any kind of communication device.\"\n\nHe stressed the importance of mobile devices being well-charged before getting on the road.\n\n\"It's good to have that safety kit with you,\" Sinclair stated.\n\n\"Very important.\"\n\nThe driving pro shared a number of different helpful safety tips for drivers to consider in the winter.\n\nWhen asked if a gas tank might freeze over if a vehicle's tank is closer to empty in extreme cold.\n\n\"It's not the gas that freezes,\" Sinclair stated.\n\n\"It's the moisture-laden air - any that's in the tank. That's why it's always recommended in cold conditions to keep your vehicle as full as possible. That is very important.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of paying particular attention to how you handle turns when driving in the snow.\n\n\"Lower your speed and be very gentle with the gas and the brake. Don't hit the gas hard. That leads to tires spinning and loss of control.\"\n\nSinclair even lets drivers know what to do if they do happen to lose control of their vehicle.\n\n\"And in the turn that you start to lose control, come off the gas gently,\" he advised.\n\n\"You don't necessarily want to jam on the brakes because that can upset the balance of the vehicle and lead to a further lost control.\"\n\nThe driving pro added that, when this happens, look and steer in the direction that you want the car to go.\n\nThe AAA pro said cold weather leads to a lot of calls for the company but not necessarily an influx from drivers calling to be saved from snow and ice.\n\n\"It's the cold weather that gives us a lot of calls,\" he said.\n\n\"The batteries [going] dead and they lose 30 percent of power at freezing and 60 percent of power near 0.

    "body": "EU carbon border tax will do little to cut emissions, ADB study says\n\nAs the world's top global energy trading houses prepare for their biggest annual industry get-together this week in London they face a growing problem, what to do with their cash.\n\nMost trading houses, which are privately owned and controlled by their employees, disclose little about their cash position, equity or dividends.\n\nBut according to more than 10 trading and banking sources and Reuters calculations, Vitol, Trafigura, Mercuria and Gunvor are collectively sitting on billions of dollars, even after paying out record dividends.\n\n\"We borrow much less from banks and are waiting for good investment opportunities. But those are slim, especially in loss-making green energy,\" said an executive at one of the top trading houses, who declined to be named.\n\nTrading houses, which already control large areas of global oil, gas and power markets, are finding it difficult to grow, while poor returns in recent years on wind, solar and hydrogen assets have irked some investors.\n\nThe cash conundrum is likely to be one of the topics on the table as traders gather for receptions and parties in London ballrooms and pubs for International Energy Week.\n\nVitol, the world's biggest trader, has increased its total equity to $26 billion even after paying $5 billion in record dividends after earning $15 billion in 2022, its non-public balance sheet, which was seen by Reuters, shows.\n\nAnd its equity will probably rise close to $30 billion based on its 2023 results if Vitol sticks to transferring a significant chunk of retained earnings to equity, two banking sources familiar with the company's performance said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercuria and Gunvor have accumulated around $6 billion each in equity and retained earnings in recent years, sources familiar with their results told Reuters.\n\nEquity figures for Vitol, Mercuria and Gunvor have not been previously reported. All three companies declined to comment.\n\nRival Trafigura disclosed in its latest report its equity grew almost 2.5 times to $16.5 billion in the last 4 years.\n\nThe equity of the big trading houses is still dwarfed by oil majors such as Shell SHEL.L with $188 billion or BP BP.L with $85 billion, according to their latest reports.\n\nMARGIN CALLS\n\nUntil a decade ago, most traders preferred to have few assets, low equity or cash positions and pay out most of their profits in dividends to their employee shareholders.\n\nThe exception was Glencore GLEN.L, which began trading as Marc Rich in the 1970s and gradually amassed coal and metals assets. It went public in 2011, raising $11 billion.\n\nTotal equity is calculated as the difference between assets, including retained earnings, and liabilities and is key to determining how much a company is worth.\n\nTrading houses have bought assets over the past decade, from oil refineries to wind farms and metals mines, using profits and money borrowed from banks while keeping their cash reserves low.\n\nThat changed in 2022 when gas prices soared after Russian gas supplies to Europe dropped as a result of Western sanctions that aimed to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTraders often hedge their positions with derivatives, usually borrowing 90% of the money to buy them while using their own cash to cover the remainder.\n\nIf prices soar, exchanges ask traders to contribute more of their own cash in so-called margin calls.\n\n\"We all faced margin calls and rushed to borrow from banks. This is when we decided it was prudent to put aside more cash,\" a second trading house executive said.\n\nSELF-FINANCED\n\nTraders such as Trafigura work with up to 150 banks and have as much as $50 billion of credit lines available.\n\nAt the peak of the margin call crisis traders used the lines in full and some banks refused to boost lending, while encouraging traders to find alternatives.\n\nMost traders decided to retain earnings as equity.\n\n\"We beefed up our equity and as a result more of our trade became self financed,\" a third trading executive said.\n\nWhen traders borrow less, banks earn less in interest and cannot increase their lending to other clients if they keep large credit lines open if these are not used.\n\n\"Banks didn't like going above credit limits in 2022. But they equally disliked it when traders barely used the lines in 2023,\" said a banker at a top U.S. bank active in the sector.\n\nBank borrowing would rise again once interest rates fall and traders spend more on investments, one of the three trading executives said. But that was not happening yet.\n\n\"Sometimes traders just borrow money and put it back on a deposit with the same or different bank so it pays interest,\" a fourth trading executive said.",

    "body": "Mexico president lambastes YouTube after company edits video revealing NYT journalist's number\n\nA European Union plan to impose tariffs on high-carbon imports could hurt developing countries in Asia but is unlikely to lead to big reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in a report published on Monday.\n\nThe Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) was introduced to address concerns that the outsourcing of manufacturing had put large parts of the EU's supply chain beyond the reach of its emissions trading scheme (ETS), a situation described as \"carbon leakage\".\n\nIt was designed to level the playing field and make foreign suppliers pay the same carbon price as domestic ones, even if they are not subject to an ETS or carbon tax at home.\n\nADB said CBAM was expected to cut Asian exports to the EU, particularly from western and southwestern Asia, with steel from India also likely to take a hit.\n\nBut any small reduction in emissions would quickly be offset by the continuing increase in carbon-intensive production throughout Asia, and mechanisms to share emission reduction technology would be more effective, it said.\n\n\"It's actually a relatively limited policy at the moment,\" said Neil Foster-McGregor, ADB's senior economist. \"It only imports into the EU (and) only covers six sectors.\n\n\"The way the scale of production is increasing, even if we do this carbon pricing more broadly across the globe, you're still going to see rising emissions unless we see a fundamental change in production techniques,\" he added.\n\nCBAM could raise around 14 billion euros ($15.2 billion) in revenue by 2030, and the proceeds should be used to provide climate finance for developing countries to decarbonise manufacturing, Foster-McGregor said.\n\nOne of the aims of CBAM was to incentivise non-EU economies to impose stricter climate policies of their own: if exporting nations can demonstrate that a carbon price has already been paid, the CBAM levy will be reduced.\n\nIndia has already discussed the possibility of imposing export taxes on CBAM-covered products sold to Europe, and China is expanding its ETS to cover exporting sectors like steel.\n\nBoth countries have been critical of CBAM, with China warning Europe not to use climate as an excuse to engage in trade protectionism.\n\nWhile CBAM serves as a tariff on foreign producers, it will also raise the cost of raw materials such as steel and fertiliser for downstream EU manufacturers, and could even give them an incentive to relocate more production capacity overseas, including Asia, the ADB report warned.\n\n\"While there is a partial offsetting of the carbon leakage in the upstream, there could be new carbon leakage downstream in the EU ... They are shooting themselves in the foot,\" said Jong Woo Kang, another senior ADB economist, speaking at a briefing on Monday.",

    "body": "KARACHI The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said it had allowed exporters to use funds in their special foreign currency accounts for any kind of payments abroad without prior approval, in a move to facilitate trade and ease of doing business.\n\n\"Authorised dealers (ADs) may allow exporters of goods and services to retain a prescribed percentage of their export proceeds in Exporters' Special Foreign Currency Account (ESFCAs),\" the SBP said in a circular.\n\n\"In this regard, the exporters may utilise these funds freely for making all types of payments abroad of current account nature to fulfil the needs of their own businesses, without prior SBP approval.\"\n\nThis action was taken by the central bank to facilitate exporters, encourage ease of doing business, and further liberalise the use of retained money.\n\n\"The authorised dealers are required to facilitate the exporters (on specific request) by issuing debit cards against balances held in ESFCAs. However, no cash withdrawal in foreign currency from ESFCAs shall be allowed within Pakistan,\" said the SBP.\n\nAs per the guidelines of the SBP, exporters may pay for imports for their business purposes as long as they comply with the relevant laws and regulations and the applicable import policy order.\n\n\"The funds in ESFCAs can also be used for making payments with regard to capital and financial account transactions, such as equity investment abroad and foreign currency loan repayments. However, in case of remittance of such transactions, the proper procedure as described in the relevant regulations shall be followed,\" it said.\n\nThe exports have shown a recovery in recent months after being hit by high energy costs and a shortage of dollars for importing raw materials.\n\nPakistan's total exports rose to $2.792 billion in January, up 24% from a year earlier. Exports increased by 7.87% to $17.778 billion in the seven months of fiscal year 2023-24.\n\nThe country's textile exports increased by 10% year-on-year to $1.45 billion in January. The export of value-added textile products rose to $1.04 billion in January, up 12% from the same month last year. Similarly, basic textiles and other textiles also witnessed an increase of 6% and 3% to stand at $0.24 billion and $0.16 billion, respectively, in January.\n\nPakistan's monthly exports of information technology were $265 million, up 39% year-on-year but down 13% month-on-month in January. January's IT exports exceeded the $227 million 12-month average. IT exports increased by 13% to $1.5 billion in July-January FY24.\n\nThe rise in IT exports, according to analysts, is the result of two factors: a stable local currency, which encouraged IT companies to repatriate their foreign income and deposit it in local accounts, and the SBP's relaxation of the permissible retention limit, which increased it from 35 to 50% in exporters' special foreign currency accounts.",

    "body": "Most die-hard sneakerheads wouldn't think twice about waiting hours in line to be the first to score the Air Jordan 4 BRED Reimagineds -- which retail for $200, but can resell for double that on the collectors market.\n\nSome write computer code to snap up pairs of limited edition Jordans and other coveted Nikes as soon as they go on sale online.\n\nAnd then there are those suspected of going to even greater lengths to get exclusive kicks.\n\nLos Angeles police are investigating a theft ring that allegedly swiped millions of dollars worth of shoes in an elaborate scheme that stretched from a cavernous Nike warehouse in Memphis, Tenn., to a swanky Hollywood apartment building.\n\nSo far, only one person has been charged in connection with the case, a 37-year-old Tennessee man who police say operated around L.A. -- allegedly with the help of a Nike employee from back East. The suspected insider has not been charged, and court records suggest others involved have also avoided arrest and prosecution. The case has roiled the L.A. sneaker world, where collectors have been left wondering whether local retailers had knowledge of the thefts.\n\nLos Angeles authorities announced the seizure of a large cache of stolen Nike gear at a news conference late last month, but a search warrant affidavit filed by LAPD detectives and reviewed by The Times offers new details into the operations of the theft ring, which remains under investigation.\n\nSince June 2023, the ring has been responsible for swiping more than $2 million in Nike products, according to the search warrant, written by LAPD Commercial Crimes Division Det. Marc Sternin, detailed to the department's cargo theft task force. Sternin's warrant, made public last month in Los Angeles County Superior Court, said the sneaker heists remain \"ongoing and pervasive.\"\n\nUnder the scheme, detectives say the suspects exploited loopholes in Nike's distribution system, starting at the source: a main hub in southeast Memphis, the origin of products shipped nationwide by the sportswear giant. The thieves printed fake shipping labels and paid off employees at UPS and Nike to \"deliberately misdirect or redirect\" cartons of shoes to locations across L.A., according to detectives.\n\nOn Jan. 10, Nike employees in Memphis discovered 10 cartons of shoes in the back of a U.S. Postal Service truck -- each with an original shipping label that had been covered by a pre-addressed mailing label for the private carrier UPS. The next day, Nike intercepted another eight of these \"over-labeled\" cartons, which contained shoes \"unavailable for sale or resale within their worldwide supply chain,\" Sternin wrote.\n\nThe sneaker economy has exploded in recent years, taking off amid the pandemic's online shopping boom. Resellers generated $10.6 billion worth of sales globally in 2022 alone, according to Market Decipher, a market-research firm. Competition for buying hard-to-find styles can be fierce. Savvier operators create software bots that can quickly buy up shoes the moment they show up on a retailer's site. Like the stock market, prices sometimes rise and fall based on real-life events -- such as the death of a celebrity designer or star athlete. Access to exclusive or \"pre-released\" models such as those in the outgoing cartons seized by Nike can be as lucrative as insider trading.\n\nIn the theft ring, detectives say, members would \"intercept\" packages with swapped labels, snatching them up somewhere along the supply chain of docks, highways and warehouses. Sometimes they would hijack packages by swapping addresses with the shipping companies after they had left Nike's warehouse, according to Sternin's affidavit.\n\nSternin said officials from Nike, which had been investigating the thefts internally, contacted the LAPD. Several emails seeking comment from Nike went unreturned.\n\nA Memphis police sergeant working with that department's cargo theft task force told Sternin that he had been working the case since last June, when he first became aware of \"numerous unidentified co-conspirators\" working at Nike's Memphis location.\n\nThe ring has also recruited UPS employees in Tennessee and California \"and possibly elsewhere within UPS and Nike supply chain network,\" according to Sternin.\n\nWhen police began investigating, a trail of footprints allegedly led back to Roy Lee Harvey of Memphis. Despite coming from the distribution center in Tennessee, the address of origin on one shipment of diverted shoes was listed as 6390 De Longpre Ave. in Los Angeles, which according to Sternin is the headquarters of RHJ Global Kicks, a company registered to Harvey in May 2020.\n\nThe same shipment was also addressed to Harvey -- at a second-story unit in an apartment complex at Hollywood Boulevard and Argyle Avenue, the detective wrote.\n\nA check of law enforcement databases determined that Harvey had a \"previous association\" with another unit on the same floor; police surmised that he may have used a familiar address or had the listed unit's current tenant in on his scheme -- a common tactic among \"cargo thieves,\" Sternin wrote.\n\nAfter obtaining search warrants for Harvey's email, iCloud data and cellphone records, investigators said they determined he had exchanged 1,101 calls and text messages over a roughly six-month period with a phone number associated with a Nike employee in Memphis.\n\nThe Nike employee, Sternin wrote, had access to areas where unreleased shoes were stored and who was working on the days the mislabeled shipments were discovered.\n\nLAPD Chief Michel Moore told the Police Commission last month that investigators performing surveillance on the Hollywood Boulevard address had seen Harvey pick up dozens of UPS packages there. Moore said that Harvey had in the past been seen delivering boxes to Project Blitz, a popular shoe reseller with a large online following and a high-profile clientele that includes celebrities such as Drake and Beyoncé.\n\nRecords show that after his arrest on Jan. 27, Harvey posted bond. Attempts to reach him were unsuccessful, and no defense attorney was listed on the court docket as of Friday morning. Beyond his arrest, little about his background is publicly known; a Memphis TV station reported recently that a review of his criminal record in surrounding Shelby County only turned up a few traffic tickets, which were dismissed.\n\nThe Los Angeles County district attorney's office has filed 27 felony counts of receiving stolen property against Harvey.\n\nMoore said some of the stolen shoes were recovered during a raid of a warehouse in Hawthorne, also on Jan. 27, where police found around $5 million worth of Nike products -- so much that it took two 53-foot semi trailers to haul away. A separate search warrant was executed in Hollywood. The seized items were said to include \"stolen Nike shoes, clothing, accessories and unique prototypes.\"\n\nThe warehouse belongs to Project Blitz, according to Moore. Company owner Andre Ljustina does not face any charges, and his name is not mentioned in the LAPD search warrant authored by Sternin. He did not respond to emails or phone calls for a number listed for him in public databases. The company's website has been down since the raid.\n\nThe LAPD case has been parsed in the online sneakerhead community, with questions raised about how much local sneaker dealers knew or should have known -- about where their merchandise was coming from. Some commenters have dismissed the case as police overreach. Others pointed out that most major resellers have relationships with shoe company officials, or plugs, who occasionally offer them first dibs on a new release.\n\nIn one video posted on YouTube, a commentator compared Project Blitz's inventory to \"a virtual sneaker museum\" and linked to an undated interview in which Ljustina was asked how the company managed to procure rare shoes that were seemingly unavailable elsewhere. \"Well, because we're friends and family,\" he responded.\n\nAmong some local resellers, the sneaker bust was met with surprise and sympathy for Project Blitz.\n\nFrank Garriola, a manager and head buyer at CoolKicks, a streetwear boutique on Los Angeles' Melrose Avenue, said the case had drawn strong interest because of Ljustina's prominence in the sneaker world. While major resellers take steps to ensure they're not dealing in stolen or fake gear, he said, it is unrealistic to expect them to account for where all of the sneakers they buy come from.\n\n\"Everybody buys sneakers from people like that,\" Garriola said referring to brokers who appear to have inside connections to shoe companies. \"And we don't know if it's stolen when we get it here.\"\n\nBased on his experience, Sternin wrote in his affadavit, a pair of unreleased Nike shoes can fetch as much as six times their original value on the \"clandestine sneaker market.\"\n\nStockX and other online marketplaces such as eBay and Poshmark have promised to crack down on stolen merchandise that is listed on their websites. Even still, some suspects peddling stolen goods have adjusted, turning to platforms that don't have as much risk, such as smaller peer-to-peer apps and exchanges. Others have turned to the old school method of selling sneakers from the trunk of their car.\n\nGarriola said it isn't unheard of for the most coveted shoes to resell for up to $2,000, depending on how limited it is and the timing. He cited the deaths of fashion designers Virgil Abloh and Chris \"Spanto\" Printup, which prompted sales of shoe models they influenced to skyrocket on resale websites. The unpredictability of the market, he said, has led to increased pressure to keep up with customer demand.\n\n\"It's just like every release is sold out, you can't really get what you want anymore,\" Garriola said. \"You really got to know what you're doing in order to make money.\"",

The EU and G7 have been debating if and how these funds can be used for over a year.\n\n\"We are following the decisions of Western countries: we have frozen no less (than they have),\" Siluanov said.\n\nSiluanov said Russia's budget is \"under control\" with revenues coming in slightly higher than expected this year.

    "body": "Singapore (AFP) - The \"Swift effect\" is about to hit Southeast Asia but Singapore has left some of its neighbours seeing red while it profits from a Taylor-made tourism boom as the star's only stop in the region.\n\nMore than 300,000 fans from the city-state and neighbouring countries will attend the US superstar's six sold-out Eras Tour shows at the National Stadium from March 2-9.\n\nIngrid Delgado, a fresh graduate in Manila who is travelling to Singapore for the March 4 show, said she bought a \"new shimmering dress\" for the occasion but had trouble finding an affordable hotel.\n\n\"A lot were booked already, so I had to book a more expensive hotel,\" she said.\n\nThe Fullerton Hotels and Resorts, as well as the Fairmont Hotel, told AFP that demand for rooms during the concert period had risen.\n\nBig spenders have taken up Marina Bay Sands' luxury packages named after Swift's hit songs, such as \"Shake it Off\" and \"Stay Stay Stay\".\n\nThe hotel's SG$50,000 ($37,230) \"Wildest Dreams\" package includes VIP tickets, fine dining, a hotel suite, limousine transfers and passes to tourist attractions.\n\nThe hotel told AFP all its packages were sold out.\n\nSingapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines said there had been increased demand for Singapore-bound flights but could not say whether it was solely due to the \"Swift Effect\".\n\nA large contingent of Malaysian Swifties will be crossing into neighbouring Singapore.\n\n\"It's a dream come true. I feel excited and nervous,\" said Harith Arsat, a 20-year-old student who will be making his first overseas trip from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn the Philippines, budget carrier Cebu Pacific has changed its usual flight number for Singapore-bound planes to \"1989\" -- the year Swift was born and the title of her fifth album -- for the March 1-9 period.\n\nHowever, not everyone was happy when Swift's only Southeast Asia stop was announced, including fans and governments in some of Singapore's neighbours.\n\nTravelling to Singapore is expensive for many in the region due to high currency exchanges, to say nothing of ritzy hotel packages.\n\nSome were also unhappy because Singapore provided a grant to help secure Swift's record-breaking tour for the city-state.\n\nOfficials from the culture ministry and Singapore Tourism Board, citing business confidentiality, declined to say last week how much was paid, or whether an exclusivity deal had been signed to make Singapore Swift's sole Southeast Asian stop.\n\nThat followed reports that Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin had told a business forum in Bangkok that Singapore had indeed made such a deal.\n\nThe Singapore officials did not address Srettha's comments directly but said Swift's shows were \"likely to generate significant benefits to the Singapore economy\".\n\nSingapore has been rolling out the red carpet for many international artists, such as Blackpink, Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, since ending its Covid-19 pandemic curbs.\n\nColdplay performed six sold-out shows in January and upcoming acts include Bruno Mars, Sum 41 and Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n\"Singapore started to open faster than others after the pandemic and its first-mover advantage and concerted efforts to bring in acts, events and conventions has helped,\" Song Seng Wun, economic adviser for CGS International, told AFP.\n\n\"That momentum has been building up.\"\n\nMillions scrambled for tickets when they went on sale last year, which led to a rise in online scams targeting desperate Swifties.\n\nSingapore police even released a social media video with the tagline: \"Don't lose money swiftly, buy your tickets safely.\"\n\nRegardless of the dangers, Ericko Dimas Pamungkas, 25, in Jakarta logged in to three devices to get a ticket queue number.\n\n\"I got very lucky. I feel like this concert is one of the most important moments for me,\" he said.\n\nSwift has evolved from a singer with relatable lyrics into a canny businesswoman and the world's biggest pop star, and fans believe there is plenty to learn from the 34-year-old.\n\n\"I appreciate Taylor's candidness and what she stands for such as rights, generosity and compassion,\" said Spencer Ler, a Singaporean pilot who queued for 22 hours to get tickets for his daughter and her friends.",

The B2B fintech increased its transaction volume* by around 8% to EUR 407 million. At EUR 51.1 million, turnover was slightly below the previous year's figure of EUR 53.6 million. The high-margin recurring SaaS business developed positively. For example, subscription-based sales of accounting and liquidity management tools increased by 30% to EUR 2 million. aifinyo increased gross profit**, one of the most important key performance indicators (KPI), by 5% to EUR 14.6 million in 2023.\n\nLast year was a year of transition for aifinyo in operational terms. Following the acquisition of Billomat and the strong growth in 2022, the focus last year was on strategic issues such as the integration of the new subsidiary and further development of the aifinyo eco-system.\n\nAt EUR 1.9 million last year, earnings before interest and taxes nearly reached the record level of EUR 2.2 million from 2022. Earnings before taxes amounted to EUR 0.2 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 1.2 million). The B2B fintech has thus grown profitably even in a difficult macroeconomic environment, invested in the cloud-based platform for managing, financing and paying invoices and strengthened its leading position in the market.The legal status of the shareholders entered in the share register will not be affected by the conversion of the no-par value bearer shares into registered shares. Their participation in the company remains unchanged, as do the rights associated with their shares. The shareholders' right to sell their shares is also not restricted or made more difficult, as the transfer of registered shares does not require the company's consent.\n\n\"The fact that we were essentially able to maintain the high level from the record year 2022 in difficult economic times confirms aifinyo's robust business model. In 2022, our number of customers more than quadrupled and gross profit almost doubled. It was therefore important to consolidate and further develop internally in 2023,\" says aifinyo CEO Stefan Kempf. \"We have done this and are in an excellent position to achieve double-digit growth again in the future. The market potential is still huge and there is still no real digital business customer bank in Germany. aifinyo wants to change this.\"\n\nThe integration of Billomat is largely complete and the subsidiary's app was relaunched at the turn of the year. While the aifinyo and Billomat brands remain separate, the platform has been standardized in the background. In addition, the first financing tools from aifinyo are available to Billomat users and the range of financing and invoice payment services is to be completed in the current year.\n\nThe aifinyo eco-system was expanded in 2023 to include an AI chatbot, among other things. The aifinyoCHAT application enables entrepreneurs and freelancers to have frequently asked customer questions answered quickly, automatically and at any time on their website by artificial intelligence (AI). The adaptive AI is based on ChatGPT technology and complies with GDPR-compliant quality standards.\n\naifinyo expects to publish its audited consolidated financial statements for 2023 at the beginning of May 2024.\n\n*Sum of factoring, finetrading, leasing and collection transactions processed\n\n**Total operating performance reduced by cost of goods sold and depreciation of leased assets\n\nAbout aifinyo\n\naifinyo is the reliable smart billing partner for entrepreneurs and freelancers to automate the billing, financing and payment of invoices. For this purpose, the fintech operates a unique platform around invoice and liquidity management including uncomplicated financing solutions in the areas of factoring, finetrading, leasing and receivables management. With Billomat, aifinyo also offers one of the leading cloud-based accounting systems in Germany, with which all invoice processes are handled simply and efficiently.\n\nThe shares (ISIN: DE000A3EX2X7) of aifinyo AG are listed on Xetra as well as in m:access, a market segment specifically for medium-sized companies within the Regulated Unofficial Market of the Munich Stock Exchange.

The B2B fintech has thus grown profitably even in a difficult macroeconomic environment, invested in the cloud-based platform for managing, financing and paying invoices and strengthened its leading position in the market.The legal status of the shareholders entered in the share register will not be affected by the conversion of the no-par value bearer shares into registered shares. Their participation in the company remains unchanged, as do the rights associated with their shares. The shareholders' right to sell their shares is also not restricted or made more difficult, as the transfer of registered shares does not require the company's consent.\n\n\"The fact that we were essentially able to maintain the high level from the record year 2022 in difficult economic times confirms aifinyo's robust business model. In 2022, our number of customers more than quadrupled and gross profit almost doubled. It was therefore important to consolidate and further develop internally in 2023,\" says aifinyo CEO Stefan Kempf. \"We have done this and are in an excellent position to achieve double-digit growth again in the future. The market potential is still huge and there is still no real digital business customer bank in Germany. aifinyo wants to change this.\"\n\nThe integration of Billomat is largely complete and the subsidiary's app was relaunched at the turn of the year. While the aifinyo and Billomat brands remain separate, the platform has been standardized in the background. In addition, the first financing tools from aifinyo are available to Billomat users and the range of financing and invoice payment services is to be completed in the current year.\n\nThe aifinyo eco-system was expanded in 2023 to include an AI chatbot, among other things. The aifinyoCHAT application enables entrepreneurs and freelancers to have frequently asked customer questions answered quickly, automatically and at any time on their website by artificial intelligence (AI). The adaptive AI is based on ChatGPT technology and complies with GDPR-compliant quality standards.\n\naifinyo expects to publish its audited consolidated financial statements for 2023 at the beginning of May 2024.\n\n*Sum of factoring, finetrading, leasing and collection transactions processed\n\n**Total operating performance reduced by cost of goods sold and depreciation of leased assets\n\nAbout aifinyo\n\naifinyo is the reliable smart billing partner for entrepreneurs and freelancers to automate the billing, financing and payment of invoices. For this purpose, the fintech operates a unique platform around invoice and liquidity management including uncomplicated financing solutions in the areas of factoring, finetrading, leasing and receivables management. With Billomat, aifinyo also offers one of the leading cloud-based accounting systems in Germany, with which all invoice processes are handled simply and efficiently.\n\nThe shares (ISIN: DE000A3EX2X7) of aifinyo AG are listed on Xetra as well as in m:access, a market segment specifically for medium-sized companies within the Regulated Unofficial Market of the Munich Stock Exchange. The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) supervises aifinyo finance GmbH as a financial services provider and aifinyo payments GmbH as a payment services provider.",

    "title": "Markets Consolidate Following Friday's Rally: All Eyes Turn to Key Data This Week | Investing.com",
    "body": "Even though we saw some consolidation on Friday following a significant rally during the week, last week ended on a great note for the major US, European and Japanese stocks. Many major indices hit ATH levels after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) reported blowout quarterly results. This week starts with the relief that there is not a major fireball that could fall in the middle of the market and wreak havoc across the financial markets. Nvidia was pointed as one thing that could possibly go wrong. And not only did it not go wrong, but it did go very well, on the contrary. But consolidation wouldn't be a bad thing, given that the S&P 500, for example, is still trading very close to the overbought market conditions, and at ATH levels.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that while everybody was watching Nvidia with their stomachs in their mouth - and the broad-based stock rally that followed its earnings, the US yields were gently drifting higher. The 2-year yield hit 4.75% last week, and the 10-year yield hit 4.35% before falling back to around 4.22% this morning. Higher yields - which are the result of the delayed rate cut expectations are not necessarily good for stock valuations, but the negative correlation between the yields and the technology stocks has significantly softened. Technology stocks go where they want to go regardless of the Fed expectations. That could change when the news flow from earnings slow and attention shifts toward the economic data and to Fed again, but there is no short interest against the Magnificent 7, investors are not willing to play against the tech giants that are clearly surfing on the AI rally, no matter where the Fed goes with its rates.\n\nThis week, investors' attention will gently shift from earnings to economic data. At this point, the US economy has been resilient and the latest uptick in the CPI data helped investors understand that the Fed will not be cutting its rates any time before summer. The first Fed cut expectation is seen coming by June, with a little less than 70% probability and the Fed is seen cutting the rates by 80bp this year. Also due this week, the latest US GDP update - due Wednesday - is expected to confirm a 3.3% growth in Q4, with a significantly lower price index. And on Thursday, the PCE data are expected to confirm relatively soft figures - softer than the CPI, most probably thanks to the different weights that the index attributes to different categories of goods and services. In all cases, a strong growth could revive the goldilocks optimism if inflation numbers continue to trend lower. For the market rally to continue, we just need strong growth and soft inflation data from the US. Easy, no?\n\nElsewhere, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will announce its latest policy decision on Wednesday and is expected to keep its rates unchanged at 5.5%. There are some rising rumors regarding the possibility of a rate hike from the RBNZ this week, but I believe that the Kiwis will simply warn that more policy tightening cannot be ruled out without however taking concrete action this week. If they did, that could eventually weigh on broad market sentiment. Yet, that's a tail risk. Other than that, Europeans will release their latest inflation updates throughout the week. Both headline and core figures are expected to have further eased below 3%. Softening European inflation - if coupled with strong US growth - could keep the EUR/USD under pressure near its 200-DMA. Even though European Central Bank's (ECB) Holzmann said last week that he doesn't see euro-area cut rates before a Fed move, the euro-area officials should face the fact that their economies are doing nowhere near the US'. Of course, the ECB cannot act alone, because a too-early rate cut compared to the Fed would dampen the euro's valuations against the US dollar and fuel inflation - something that no one wants to happen. But fundamentally, the Europeans are in a better position to start cutting first and I continue to believe that the EUR/USD deserves more to depreciate against the greenback at the current levels than the contrary.",

Lives are at stake, and their negligence cannot be tolerated any longer.\"\n\nThe authorities in Karnataka, especially in Bengaluru, are crossing their fingers regarding the evolving situation in the state concerning the availability of drinking water, as the rainy season is four months away and water reserves have depleted alarmingly.

However, he praised Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for granting Rs 100 crore for the development of Anjanadri pilgrimage centre, believed to be the birth place of Lord Hanuman in Koppal district of Karnataka.\n\nBJP and JD (S) were banking on Reddy to ensure the victory of their fifth candidate Kupendra Reddy.\n\nHowever, Janardhana Reddy has kept mum over which party he will support in the Rajya Sabha elections. The Rajya Sabha elections from Karnataka are being held for four seats. Congress has fielded AICC Treasurer Ajay Maken, Rajya Sabha MP Syed Naseer Hussain and G.C. Chandrashekhar.\n\nSenior BJP leader Narayansa Bandage and Kupendra Reddy, from the JD-S have filed their nominations as the candidates of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) for the Rajya Sabha. The fielding of Kupendra Reddy as the fifth candidate has created intense competition between the ruling Congress and the BJP.",

    "body": "Job vacancies have tumbled nearly 15pc as businesses struggle to hire in the face of high borrowing costs and while the UK battles a recession.\n\nVacancies in January fell below 900,000 for the first time since April 2021, according to data from the jobs search engine Adzuna, a drop of 15pc from a year earlier.\n\nThe downturn will fuel hopes of an interest rate cut sooner rather than later, after the Bank of England raised borrowing costs 14 consecutive times before leaving interest rates unchanged at 5.25pc since last August.\n\nIn high interest rate environments, businesses' budgets are stretched as borrowing becomes more expensive. This means there is less cash to hire new employees. Economic uncertainty in times of recession also slows hiring.\n\nChanges in the Bank Rate take approximately a year to filter through to employers' decisions, but the weakening jobs market suggests that the effects have started to be felt.\n\nAndrew Hunter, of Adzuna, said: \"As we predicted last month, January 2024 has proven to be one of the most difficult starts to the year for job hunters in recent years with companies continuing to put hiring plans on ice.\n\n\"This will be disappointing for those hunting for work and only serves to drive up competition nationwide for available roles.\"\n\nIt comes as Britain's businesses begin to feel the pinch over disruption in the Red Sea, which has seen container ships attacked by Houthi rebels.\n\nMore than half of manufacturers and exporters said they have been affected by the disruption, a survey of 1,000 businesses by the British Chambers of Commerce found.\n\nWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said that the full implication of the disruption was yet to be felt across the economy.\n\nMr Bain said: \"There has been spare capacity in the shipping freight industry to respond to the difficulties, which has bought us some time.\n\n\"But our research suggests that the longer the current situation persists, the more likely it is that the cost pressures will start to build.\"\n\nThe Red Sea route through the Suez Canal normally accounts for 15pc of global sea trade.\n\nThe US and the UK have been launching retaliatory strikes against the rebels since January, but Houthi representatives said that the bombing would not stop ­further attacks.",

The International Monetary Fund expects the economy to continue growing and rise 2.6% in 2024.\n\nExperts say Russia's growth is driven primarily by war spending and subsidies. This means few benefits from the growth are trickling down to the regular Russian person.\n\nIn January, Alexandra Prokopenko, a former Russian central bank official, wrote in Foreign Affairs that Moscow's current military spending has overshadowed social spending for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n\"This pivot toward a militarized economy threatens social and developmental needs,\" wrote Prokopenko, a scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and a researcher at the Center of Eastern European and International Studies.\n\nRussia has also been facing a labor crunch due to the war and a massive brain drain.\n\nAn International Monetary Fund official told CNBC earlier this month that Russia's economy is starting to look like the Soviet Union's.\n\nPutin is seeking a fifth presidential term in Russia's upcoming election in March. The 71-year-old Russian leader is expected to win the race against three opponents.",

    "body": "Some of the leading voices in the North's private equity and investment community have stepped up their efforts to tell political leaders about the importance of private capital for the UK economy - particularly the role it can play in driving growth in the regions.\n\nGarry Wilson, founder of Endless, and Lucie Mills, investment director at NorthEdge, were both part of a British Private Equity & Venture Capital Association (BVCA) team that met with Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves in Leeds on Friday.\n\nWilson is the current chair of the BVCA.\n\nThe pair were also part of a group that met Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham last week at a meeting in London.\n\nAnd both will be speaking at the Rainmakers conference, organised by TheBusinessDesk.com on 20 March 2024.\n\nMills said: \"At both sessions we were able to bring to life the work we do with our portfolio companies and our amazing management teams - highlighting the real-world and very human impact of private capital.\n\n\"It's a privilege to represent NorthEdge in these important discussions. We recognise that as regionally-focussed investors we have a huge part to play in ensuring our industry can continue to contribute positively to our economy and society. We're so proud of the number of national and international businesses that we have supported that are based in the UK regions, which is why we're committed to using our voice; working alongside Government and Education; and delivering sustainable returns for our stakeholders - demonstrating the attractiveness and the power of the regions.\"\n\nRachel Reeves said: \"The private equity and venture capital sector is incredibly important for fulfilling our mission to grow the economy. The work that you do ensuring that businesses can attract fast growing capital and the turning around businesses is vital for economic growth.\"\n\nOne of the issues raised with Reeves was the importance of broadening pension fund access to private equity and venture capital.\n\nMembers also used the meeting to highlight the value of their work in growing and supporting British businesses to the Shadow Chancellor, and deploying the £145bn of dry powder capital that is available to be invested in the next 3-5 years.\n\nThe Shadow Chancellor emphasised her commitment to boosting pension investment in private capital in order to drive better returns for savers and growth for British businesses.\n\nPolicy conclusions from the BVCA's new Investment Commission were also discussed, as well as key areas in Labour's recent financial services review, including: Making the UK a world leader in sustainable finance; Labour's plan to reinvigorate capital markets; Pooling LGPS and reviewing the state of pensions in the UK.\n\nProjecting a strong voice for the region's homegrown Northern investment businesses is one of the founding principles behind the first Rainmakers Conference to be held at The Point conferencing facilities at the Emirates Old Trafford on March 20, 2024 and organised by TheBusinessDesk.com.\n\nThe conference will be an opportunity to not only celebrate the contribution from funds raised and deals created, but also to look to the future at the challenges ahead.\n\nThe event has been forged alongside the key partners from private equity and specialist financiers in the North, and backed by elite teams of advisory businesses, the event will bring together funders, entrepreneurs, business leaders to focus on opportunities and challenges.",

Like what you see? You can subscribe here.\n\nNikkei extends rally\n\nJapan'sNikkei 225 hit a fresh high Monday as trading resumed after a long weekend, while China markets were set to snap a nine-day winning run. The broader Topix also gained. Wall Street hit another record on Friday as markets wrapped the week on a positive note with help from Nvidia's bumper earnings. The S&P 500 gained 0.03% hitting fresh highs, while the Dow also closed at an all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.28% but touched a fresh 52-week high in the session.\n\nXiaomi's big EV bet\n\nChinese smartphone company Xiaomi is betting big on its new electric vehicle. The firm is putting a premium price on its first electric car, targeting around 20 million users, Group President Weibing Lu told CNBC. There are, however, doubts over Xiaomi's ability to sell the car, given its reputation as a maker of lower-priced products.\n\nSouth Korea market measures\n\nSouth Korea's financial regulatory body unveiled new measures to improve corporate governance on Monday. The move by the FSC underlined steps authorities were taking to boost valuations of stock markets in Asia's fourth-largest economy.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway earnings jump\n\nBerkshire Hathaway operating earnings surged 28% in the fourth quarter, while its cash pile soared to record levels. For the full year, operating earnings rose to $37.35 billion, up 17% from $30.85 billion in the previous year.\n\n[Pro] China AI stocks surge\n\nEven if China's broader market recovery remains muted, Chinese artificial intelligence stocks are rising. Analysts are bullish on tech giant Baidu -- which Morgan Stanley called the \"best AI play in China Internet.\" The company is set to release earnings this week.\n\nAl euphoria took over Wall Street last week, thanks to Nvidia.\n\nThe chipmaker's market cap briefly topped $2 trillion on Friday, after posting blockbuster earnings that fueled a powerful stock rally.\n\nAll three indexes rose more than 1% on the week, with both the Dow and S&P posting record closes.\n\nMarket watchers seem optimistic the current rally has legs since it's driven by strong earnings.\n\n\"I hope you're enjoying the party. Obviously, Nvidia was the grand finale for the earnings announcement season,\" said Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates last week.\n\n\"This is why earnings season is so important... things are good. This quarter this year is strongest since the late 1999.\"\n\nStill, it remains to be seen whether the AI momentum can last as inflation risks linger.\n\nInvestors, so far, have shrugged off the Fed's cautious tone on interest rates and focused on the AI fervor. But that could change as a big inflation data point is due this week that could spook Wall Street.\n\nThe personal-consumption expenditures index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will be released Thursday. This comes on the heels of recent hot consumer and wholesale prices that delivered a one-two punch to markets.\n\nIf the PCE data surprises on the upside that could dampen the markets' bullish mood.",

The broader Topix index finished 12.91 points, or 0.49 percent, higher at 2,673.62, its highest level since February 1990. Japanese markets were closed Friday for a public holiday.\n\nOn the top-tier Prime Market, gainers were led by pharmaceutical, precision instrument and bank shares.\n\nThe U.S. dollar remained mostly unchanged at the mid-150 yen level in Tokyo amid a lack of fresh trading cues.\n\nOn the stock market, a wide range of issues drew buying on optimism for upbeat earnings by Japanese companies, propelling the Nikkei index to refresh both its closing and intraday highs for the second straight trading day. The benchmark index surpassed the previous records set Thursday for the first time since December 1989.\n\n\"Japanese stocks are seen as cheap, with the added advantage of a weak yen. And low interest rates, inflation, and relatively cheap valuations make Japanese stocks even more attractive to foreign investors,\" said Seiichi Suzuki, chief equity market analyst at the Tokai Tokyo Research Institute.\n\nBut the upside was capped on Monday, as the selling of Tokyo Electron and other semiconductor-related stocks that surged last week on U.S. chip giant Nvidia Corp.'s positive earnings and outlook led to a slight market correction, Suzuki said.\n\n\"Whether it is due to caution over recent rises or profit-taking, it seems like there weren't as many buyers today as there were last week,\" he said, adding that investors are also keeping an eye on key U.S. economic indicators due out later this week.",

    "body": "PAY ATTENTION: Honest Talk with MEDIKAL on YEN X SPACE. Join us today, Feb 19, at 8PM\n\nThe \"Swift effect\" is about to hit Southeast Asia but Singapore has left some of its neighbours seeing red while it profits from a Taylor-made tourism boom as the star's only stop in the region.\n\nMore than 300,000 fans from the city-state and neighbouring countries will attend the US superstar's six sold-out Eras Tour shows at the National Stadium from March 2-9.\n\nIngrid Delgado, a fresh graduate in Manila who is travelling to Singapore for the March 4 show, said she bought a \"new shimmering dress\" for the occasion but had trouble finding an affordable hotel.\n\n\"A lot were booked already, so I had to book a more expensive hotel,\" she said.\n\nThe Fullerton Hotels and Resorts, as well as the Fairmont Hotel, told AFP that demand for rooms during the concert period had risen.\n\nBig spenders have taken up Marina Bay Sands' luxury packages named after Swift's hit songs, such as \"Shake it Off\" and \"Stay Stay Stay\".\n\nThe hotel's SG$50,000 ($37,230) \"Wildest Dreams\" package includes VIP tickets, fine dining, a hotel suite, limousine transfers and passes to tourist attractions.\n\nThe hotel told AFP all its packages were sold out.\n\nSingapore Airlines and Malaysia Airlines said there had been increased demand for Singapore-bound flights but could not say whether it was solely due to the \"Swift Effect\".\n\nA large contingent of Malaysian Swifties will be crossing into neighbouring Singapore.\n\n\"It's a dream come true. I feel excited and nervous,\" said Harith Arsat, a 20-year-old student who will be making his first overseas trip from Kuala Lumpur.\n\nIn the Philippines, budget carrier Cebu Pacific has changed its usual flight number for Singapore-bound planes to \"1989\" -- the year Swift was born and the title of her fifth album -- for the March 1-9 period.\n\nHowever, not everyone was happy when Swift's only Southeast Asia stop was announced, including fans and governments in some of Singapore's neighbours.\n\nTravelling to Singapore is expensive for many in the region due to high currency exchanges, to say nothing of ritzy hotel packages.\n\nSome were also unhappy because Singapore provided a grant to help secure Swift's record-breaking tour for the city-state.\n\nOfficials from the culture ministry and Singapore Tourism Board, citing business confidentiality, declined to say last week how much was paid, or whether an exclusivity deal had been signed to make Singapore Swift's sole Southeast Asian stop.\n\nThat followed reports that Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin had told a business forum in Bangkok that Singapore had indeed made such a deal.\n\nThe Singapore officials did not address Srettha's comments directly but said Swift's shows were \"likely to generate significant benefits to the Singapore economy\".\n\nSingapore has been rolling out the red carpet for many international artists, such as Blackpink, Harry Styles and Ed Sheeran, since ending its Covid-19 pandemic curbs.\n\nColdplay performed six sold-out shows in January and upcoming acts include Bruno Mars, Sum 41 and Jerry Seinfeld.\n\n\"Singapore started to open faster than others after the pandemic and its first-mover advantage and concerted efforts to bring in acts, events and conventions has helped,\" Song Seng Wun, economic adviser for CGS International, told AFP.\n\n\"That momentum has been building up.\"\n\nMillions scrambled for tickets when they went on sale last year, which led to a rise in online scams targeting desperate Swifties.\n\nSingapore police even released a social media video with the tagline: \"Don't lose money swiftly, buy your tickets safely.\"\n\nRegardless of the dangers, Ericko Dimas Pamungkas, 25, in Jakarta logged in to three devices to get a ticket queue number.\n\n\"I got very lucky. I feel like this concert is one of the most important moments for me,\" he said.\n\nSwift has evolved from a singer with relatable lyrics into a canny businesswoman and the world's biggest pop star, and fans believe there is plenty to learn from the 34-year-old.\n\n\"I appreciate Taylor's candidness and what she stands for such as rights, generosity and compassion,\" said Spencer Ler, a Singaporean pilot who queued for 22 hours to get tickets for his daughter and her friends.",

Four important pillars of Viksit Bharat are poor, youth, farmers and women. And notably, the textile sector of Bharat is connected with all these pillars. Therefore, an event like Bharat Tex becomes very important for us all,\" Modi said.\n\nHe further said in 2014, the valuation of textile market of India was less than Rs 7 lakh crore, whereas it has now crossed Rs 12 lakh crore.\n\nThe prime minister also said that during the last 10 years, there has been a 25 per cent rise in the production of yarn, fabric and apparel.\n\nThe government is very much focused on quality control in the textile sector, he added.\n\n\"Our government is fully committed to support you in all your endeavours,\" the prime minister said.\n\nBharat Tex 2024 is expected to witness participation of policymakers and global CEOs, over 3,500 exhibitors, over 3,000 buyers from over 100 countries, and more than 40,000 business visitors, besides textiles students, weavers, artisans and textile workers.",

    "body": "FRANKFURT, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The first vessel carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) for Germany's Baltic Sea terminal of Mukran arrived on Saturday for a test operation as the country steps up its quest to replace Russian pipeline gas.\n\nPrivate company Deutsche ReGas said that Energos Power, a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), had moored at the terminal on Ruegen island, having received approval from local authorities.\n\nGermany has intensified its quest to increase LNG capacity for regasification on its shores, as European countries seek to reduce their heavy reliance on Russian gas following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe tests will entail pilot operations and later the commissioning of all equipment.\n\nThe FSRU, formerly Transgas Power before a change of ownership, had received its LNG cargo, originally from the Norwegian Snohvit gas field, from another LNG tanker in France, ReGas said in a statement.\n\n\"We will feed gas from Mukran into the German long-distance pipeline network in what remains of the winter,\" said supervisory board member Stephan Knabe, adding the move would support supply security in eastern Germany and south eastern European countries.\n\nGermany already has LNG terminals at Wilhelmshaven and Brunsbuettel on the North Sea and at Lubmin on the Baltic Sea coast, while another one, the Elbe river port of Stade, also expects its first FSRU to arrive in coming weeks.\n\nThe Energos Power will be complemented by a second ship, the Neptune, which is currently active at Lubmin, from the spring of 2024 onwards, ReGas said.\n\nOnce the Neptune has moved to Ruegen, a complicated shuttle service to account for shallow water near Lubmin, can be abandoned.\n\n(Reporting by Andreas Rinke and Vera Eckert, editing by Clelia Oziel)",

    "title": "Navigating Uncharted Waters: The End Of Consortia's Safe Harbour And The Tidal Shift In Shipping Regulation - Marine/ Shipping - European Union",
    "body": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nIn 2009, the European Commission (EC) adopted the Consortia Block Exemption Regulation (CBER) to facilitate certain collaborative arrangements amongst shipping companies operating joint liner shipping services. This regulation aimed at promoting economies of scale and ensuring benefits were equitably shared, particularly supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Despite being extended in 2014 and 2020, with the last extension set to expire on April 25, 2024, the EC has decided against further extension due to significant changes in the competitive dynamics within the liner shipping industry.\n\nThe CBER was designed to provide a \"safe harbour\" for consortia that enabled shipping companies to achieve efficiencies and offer competitive pricing without breaching EU antitrust laws. It initially was scheduled to expire in 2015 and was subsequently extended due to the positive outcomes observed, such as reduced costs for carriers and lower prices for consumers, without adversely affecting competition.\n\nFollowing a call for evidence launched in August 2022, the EC published a Staff Working Document leading to the decision not to extend the CBER beyond April 25, 2024. This decision was influenced by changes in the competitive landscape of the liner shipping industry, including market concentration among fewer dominant players and increased cooperation through alliances, resulting in the reduction of small and medium-sized carriers, the primary beneficiaries of the CBER.\n\nPost-CBER, shipping consortia will be subject to the general EU antitrust framework, notably stricter scrutiny under the Specialisation Block Exemption Regulation and the new Guidelines on horizontal cooperation agreements. The permissible market share threshold for consortia will decrease from 30% to 20%, necessitating carriers to reassess their consortia agreements for compliance with antitrust laws on a more individual basis.\n\nThe end of the CBER signifies a pivotal change for shipping companies, especially SMEs. Carriers previously benefiting from the CBER exemption must now conduct self-assessments to determine if their consortia agreements risk being deemed anticompetitive. If so, they must evaluate whether individual exemption criteria under Article 101(3) TFEU are met. This exemption requires demonstrating tangible consumer benefits, passing on efficiencies to customers, limiting restrictions to what is necessary, and not eliminating competition entirely. Unlike the CBER's presumption, these criteria must now be demonstrated on a case-by-case basis. Companies currently engaged in consortia should assess the viability of continuing unchanged, modifying, or terminating their cooperation before the CBER expires.\n\nIn lieu of consortia, there may be a pivot towards Vessel Sharing Agreements (VSAs) (bilateral agreements negotiated between two companies). These agreements may involve \"slot swaps\", exchanging space on each other's ships, or purchasing space on another operator's vessels based on a slot contract, whether used or not. Unlike consortia, these types of agreements do not include a common marketing and negotiation strategy between carriers.\n\nThe non-renewal of the CBER marks a significant regulatory shift, necessitating a strategic reassessment by shipping companies, particularly those reliant on consortia for operational efficiencies and market competitiveness. As the industry transitions towards this new regulatory environment, stakeholders must carefully evaluate their collaborative practices to ensure compliance, sustainability, and competitiveness in the evolving market landscape.",

    "title": "Assessing Lender Risk In Fund Finance Markets 2024 (GLI Chapter) - Fund Finance - Worldwide",
    "body": "The chapter titled 'assessing lender risk in fund finance markets' includes commentary on risk analysis in an evolving market, complex fund structures market risk and conclusions.\n\nDespite being a relatively long-standing lending product, there have been limited public payment defaults by funds in the fund finance space. Consequently, the market has legitimately considered this to be a safe product for lenders and encouraged more market actors to participate. While the market has weathered, even prospered, in the face of certain challenges (from the 2008 global financial crisis to the US bank failures of March 2023), there are a new set of challenges (and opportunities) ahead. The impact of anticipated changes to large bank capital requirements in the US is being felt, with demand exceeding supply, leading to an increased focus on innovative solutions and non-bank lenders entering and expanding their footprint in the fund finance market. With these changes in mind, lenders of all shapes and sizes should remain alert to their possible (and changing) exposure.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the market has seen a significant increase in the use of NAV facilities. Market changes have also seen an increase in the use of other alternative lending structures, for example, hybrid facilities. There has also been an increase in the number of GP facilities and loans made to single LP funds.\n\nThe market has seen global interest rates rise rapidly and although this has resulted in widening margins, which is clearly a plus for lenders, the higher cost of borrowing can depress utilisations. In response, lenders often seek to increase commitment fees to make up for the unused portions and in a market that has less overall liquidity, ensuring that balance sheets are well used will remain important.\n\nGiven the overall market turbulence, there is an increased focus on mitigating risk and now is a good time for lenders to conduct their gap analysis and to protect against potential future risks in an evolving market. We examine below some of the key and emerging risks that lenders should be aware of and discuss strategies to manage and mitigate these risks.\n\nOur expertise is in advising lenders in relation to funds established in our key jurisdictions, principally the Cayman Islands, Guernsey and Jersey, although we also see activity in the British Virgin Islands and Bermuda. The market in each of these jurisdictions is broad and we see all types of alternative asset classes. The areas of risk that we focus on below relate to:\n\n* complex fund structures, primarily involving fund partnerships; and\n\nIn Jersey and Guernsey, funds are commonly established as either corporate vehicles/corporate group structures (using companies limited by shares, protected cell companies or incorporated cell companies) or, more frequently, limited partnerships with a corporate general partner, often with an interposed GPLP between corporate general partner and the fund limited partnership (referred to as the \"private equity model\", \"layering\", or \"stacking\"). To this basic framework is added any number of entities from a variety of jurisdictions: (i) fund asset-holding structures; (ii) carried interest and fee-sharing structures; (iii) feeder funds; and (iv) co-investment and other managed entity arrangements, each of which may guarantee and cross-collateralise lending.\n\nIn the Cayman Islands, the exempted limited partnership is the most common form of entity used to establish closed-ended funds, although funds may also be formed as exempted limited companies or limited liability companies.\n\nIn the British Virgin Islands, closed-ended funds are most commonly structured as limited partnerships. Less common, but nevertheless possible, funds may be structured as British Virgin Islands business companies.\n\nFeeder vehicles\n\nInvestors, for example, US investors, for ERISA purposes, will often invest in a feeder vehicle, which, in turn, invests in a master fund.\n\nThe feeder fund may present a greater degree of risk to a lender, as the lender will be a further step removed from the ultimate investors and source of funds for repayment of borrowings, and will need to rely on a chain of drawdowns (both at the master fund level and subsequently at the feeder fund level) in order for capital commitments to be paid down into the master fund borrower. To mitigate this risk, lenders will typically seek to join the feeder vehicle as a party to the finance documents, and take security over the uncalled commitments in the feeder vehicle in addition to that of the master fund, although this is not always permitted under the relevant constitutional documents.\n\nWhere this type of security is not possible, either due to restrictions in the security regimes in certain jurisdictions or, if the constitutional documents of the feeder vehicle contain limitations as to borrowing or guaranteeing, preventing the feeder from providing direct security, then the lender may be able to take cascading security as an alternative. Cascading security is where the feeder vehicle grants security over its uncalled commitments to the master fund and, in turn, the master fund grants security over its rights in the feeder vehicle security agreement to the lender (the terms of which would include an appropriate power of attorney and step-in rights).\n\nComplex cross-jurisdictional fund structures can present a number of capacity issues that need to be fully understood in each jurisdiction. This is most evident where there are layered or stacked general partner or manager arrangements across jurisdictions, and it is crucial that the correct capacities are tracked through the relevant transaction documents. In the fund documents, the power to issue drawdown notices to limited partners is almost invariably vested in the manager or general partner on behalf of the fund vehicle, but it should also be considered whether either entity holds any power or right in its own capacity.\n\nWhere the general partner delegates any of its powers relating to the calling of capital or the enforcement of the same to a manager, the security should fully reflect that chain of authority and capture both the rights of the general partner in the partnership agreement and also any such rights delegated to the manager pursuant to any management agreement. Failure to do so may cause step-in rights to be ineffective on enforcement.\n\nSimilarly, it is surprising how often we come across bank account mandates that do not align with the structure as initially presented to the lending bank, or that do not reflect the correct chain of authority or rights in respect of the monies in the account. In these instances, either the mandate or security agreement should be amended to ensure that the named account holder is the grantor of the account security, and that both reflect the chain of authority for each of the grantor's capacities.\n\nCross-jurisdictional funds\n\nWhere a combination of jurisdictions are involved in a fund structure, there is an added level of complexity in determining the appropriate governing law for the security package, as the contractual arrangements may well be governed by a mixture of regimes.\n\nWe are often asked to advise on the most appropriate governing law for the security, particularly where the finance documents are governed by, for example, English law or New York law, and the fund vehicle is a Jersey, Guernsey or Cayman Islands entity.\n\nIn these circumstances, from a Jersey and Guernsey law perspective, we are likely to advise that specific local law security is taken over contractual arrangements that are, themselves, governed by such laws. Usually, such structures also have a general partner or manager in Jersey or Guernsey. An added complexity arises where there is a general partner resident in a different jurisdiction to the governing law of the limited partnership agreement. In such case, generally, we would expect the governing law of the security over the capital call rights to follow the governing law of the limited partnership agreement, but careful analysis is required.\n\nIn contrast, in the Cayman Islands, it is not particularly common as a matter of market practice to take Cayman Islands security simply because the fund documents are governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands or if the general partner or manager is formed within the jurisdiction.\n\nSimilar issues may need to be considered in light of the situs of the collateral involved. For example, some security regimes (such as Jersey and Guernsey) provide that security must be taken in the jurisdiction where the asset has its situs. Therefore, where a Jersey bank account is to be secured, a Jersey security interest will need to be obtained over that account, irrespective of the existence of any foreign law security.\n\nAgain, in contrast, the Cayman Islands do not generally have any mandatory provisions of law that would require Cayman Islands security be taken over assets with their situs within the jurisdiction, and courts will generally respect and give effect to valid foreign law security. However, it is worth noting that, notwithstanding the governing law of the security taken, there are a number of standard provisions that should invariably be included within Cayman Islands security documents that are helpful to lenders and are, in our experience, usually absent from foreign law security documents. It is also of integral importance to ensure that, no matter what the governing law of the security itself may be, any security taken properly reflects the perfection requirements applicable to the Cayman situs property.\n\nOverall, we would also note that there is a relatively clear difference in practice between markets; the US market would tend to use US law security over capital call rights where local law permits, whereas the European market, and in particular in the UK, will largely see taking local law security as the preferred approach even where English law security is considered sufficient under local law. The former US-style approach is not possible in respect of security over Guernsey or Jersey law-governed capital call rights unless the security agreement complies with all local law requirements and the relevant provisions are governed by local law. It is usually much more efficient to start with a local law document.\n\nContractual matrix\n\nAs noted above, a careful review of the full contractual matrix is vital in ascertaining the extent of the parties' capacities, rights and powers. In time-limited situations or repeat transactions, there may be pressure from parties to undertake a limited review of documents in an attempt to shorten the transaction time and lower the legal spend. This is likely to be a false economy, as the review may identify gaps and issues that, left unchecked, could have expensive consequences.\n\nFor example, investors will regularly seek to effect changes to the terms of the partnership/constitutive documents to meet their requirements, whether by way of direct amendment to the documents themselves, or by way of side letter. If a complete and timely review is not conducted, relevant contractual provisions may be missed or discovered too late in the process. Indeed, what may seem a minor amendment from the perspective of an investor or a fund (such as restrictions on the power of attorney or additional procedural hurdles for the delivery of drawdown notices) could, for a lender, result in costly consequences; for example, by defeating an integral aspect of the security package or rendering it difficult or impractical to enforce the underlying commitments.\n\nAny introduction of conditionality to an investor's obligation to fund a drawdown may put the ability to draw the capital at risk. If lenders require the full pack of fund documents at an earlier stage, before they are executed, and allow due time for these to be reviewed, this situation can largely be avoided. Further, if engaged early enough during the period when the fund is negotiating its constitutive documents and/or side letters with cornerstone investors, lender counsel can often add value by suggesting minor clarifications and amendments to the drafting, which could avoid the need for future complex drafting in the facility, or worse lending terms for the fund. There has been a notable shift in the market as both borrowers and lenders appreciate the value in this type of due diligence, as well as the potential exposure where it is not undertaken.\n\nTechnological assistance\n\nWhen used in conjunction with a traditional review, technology can be a useful aid to reduce document review times and ensure there are no gaps or new contractual limitations introduced.\n\nAs technology develops, contract mapping, legal automation and smart contracts will likely become more widely adopted in legal and banking practice. There are numerous blockchain initiatives in the banking and finance space, which shows that contracting by smart contract is increasingly seen as a credible means of contracting, for example, blockchain solutions for standardised contracts such as ISDA and discussion around the digital future for syndicated loans.\n\nIn parallel fund arrangements, there are often either prohibitions or intra-fund limits in the parallel investment agreements or co-investment agreements, making guarantees subject to either a specific limit (being the lower of a percentage of the fund commitment or the aggregate of undrawn commitments) and/or requiring they be given in accordance with the partnership proportion (often linked to the capital commitments in each fund), effectively capping the ability of each parallel fund to guarantee the liabilities of the other. Practically, this means: (i) there will need to be amendments to the standard facility agreement drafting; and (ii) it is hard, or even impossible, for a lender to adequately monitor whether such caps have been breached, particularly as committed levels in parallel funds may shift as a result of defaulting or excused investors or due to secondary movements where the transferee prefers to be an investor in the other parallel fund. Not only does this highlight the importance of robust information covenants within facility agreements and/or third-party security documents, but also the importance of relationships with fund administrators who will be in possession of key information, in the event that step-in rights are exercised following a default.\n\nFeedback from industry participants indicates that the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has been most effective in the fund administration space and less effective in connection with due diligence and deal sourcing. Consequently:\n\n(i) the extent to which AI will play a significant role in, for example, negotiation of side letters and side letter reviews conducted by lenders and their legal counsel is linked to whether that technology can be developed to produce reliable data based on interpretation of more complex contractual provisions; and\n\n(ii) there is hope that the success of AI in the fund administration space could give lenders \"live\" access on a blockchain platform to account information for all accounts (even those not held with them).\n\nWaiver of commitments\n\nThough clearly a notably rare event, and indeed, one that many lenders would perhaps see as a diligence matter, recent cases have demonstrated that it is worth considering how to prevent or protect against the unilateral waiver or release of investor commitments by a fund, notwithstanding that it may be a breach of the finance documents to do so.\n\nSome jurisdictions have enacted specific statutory provisions to mitigate the risk of waiver in certain circumstances by enabling lenders to enforce the original fund obligations directly against the investors. While in the Cayman Islands this statutory protection has been introduced with respect to limited liability companies, it is not something that applies to exempted companies or exempted limited partnerships, which represent the majority of Cayman Islands funds. Similarly, under Jersey and Guernsey law, in the absence of express statutory provisions regulating lending to fund vehicles, lenders would only have access to more practical solutions (such as notifying the investors about the granting of security to the lenders) and traditional remedies.\n\nMarket practice has developed to mitigate such risks through practical means by ensuring that borrowers give their investors notice of the security being granted as well as relevant covenants in the facility agreement, including the usual prohibitions on the general partner or manager cancelling or waiving investor commitments. Jersey, Guernsey and Cayman Islands practice remains pragmatic and does not usually require a signed acknowledgment of the notice to be provided by each investor (although this would be preferred), but lenders are advised to request and obtain evidence of notice being given to investors. Notice can be given: (a) in the traditional manner by hard copy; (b) by uploading the notice in investor portals; or (c) by emailing the investor. We typically see combinations of (a), (b) and (c) being used depending on the general context, the particular lender and the make-up of the investor base. If notice is given using method (b) alone, we advise lenders to request evidence that each investor has accessed and reviewed the notice if uploaded to an investor portal (wherever possible).\n\nThese steps are not required under statute but are practical steps to evidence that actual notice of the security has been given to investors, and may go some way to mitigate certain risks on enforcement.\n\nRemedies: The principal remedy for balance-sheet-solvent structures is to call an event of default, accelerate the debt and enforce the transaction security. However, for insolvent structures or where the default prompts insolvency, the remedies include:\n\n(i) redress under the relevant statutory framework relevant to fraud and solvency generally and, in respect of corporate entities, transactions at an undervalue and fraudulent trading;\n\n(ii) equitable remedies including claims against the management and dishonest assistance;\n\n(iii) tortious remedies including inducing a breach of contract and lawful or unlawful means of conspiracy; and\n\n(iv) customary law remedies in relation to fraud and, particularly, defrauding creditors.\n\nThese are explored in greater detail in respect of funds domiciled in the Cayman Islands in the article by Alistair Russell, Richard Munden and James Webb entitled: \"Fund finance and releases of investor commitments: How can lenders protect themselves?\"\n\nIn Jersey, the relevant factual matrix will dictate the most appropriate course of action for the lender and clarify why the general partner or manager agreed to the waiver in the first place, but the starting point will usually be to consider what consideration (monetary or otherwise) the general partner or manager received in return for granting the waiver.\n\nIn our view, fund documents should ideally be drafted so as to provide lenders with a direct contractual right against investors preventing such a waiver, or release without lender consent. While this may not be practicable in many cases, efforts to move the market in this direction for certain types of funds would no doubt be welcomed by lenders. Notably, this is a right they are afforded statutorily in certain jurisdictions (for example, in the State of Delaware).\n\nWhere such a right is not granted (for instance, because the fund documents have already been executed), we would recommend that lenders ensure that the usual contractual restrictions on the fund's ability to waive or release the commitments are clearly communicated to the investors. This may help a lender seek a variety of remedies in the event of an unauthorised waiver, given that many such remedies will involve demonstrating a level of dishonesty or knowledge on the part of such investors.\n\nThere is also an added protection in the form of a statutory clawback in the Limited Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1994, which provides that, for a period of six months from the date of receipt, a limited partner is liable to repay (in whole or part) a payment it received representing a return of its contribution to the partnership with interest to the extent necessary to discharge a debt or obligation of the limited partnership incurred during the period that the contribution represented an asset of the limited partnership.\n\nA waiver would probably hold if an investor would not reasonably be expected to know that it was given without lender consent or in breach of the fund's obligations and such investor had provided consideration or altered its position in reliance on the waiver. For these reasons, it is worthwhile that a lender seeks to protect its position in this regard.\n\nAs lawyers, we generally leave technical market analysis to those better qualified; however, in the course of our work, certain trends do become apparent that are of note in the context of risk. We look at four of those trends below, being:\n\n* the impact of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors on credit risk.\n\nCompetition in the market\n\nPrior to the US bank failures in 2023, recent years had seen an appreciable increase in the number of lenders and borrowers in the fund finance space, a fact echoed by many advisors and market participants.\n\nIn addition, subscription line facilities have historically benefitted from lower margins, which is no doubt popular with borrowers. Although macroeconomic factors and new tighter capital adequacy rules are thought to have widened margins on subscription line facilities, the fund finance market has proved resilient in the face of these headwinds. These same headwinds have, however, served to increase further the need to avoid unnecessary structural (or other) concerns; margins predicated on lenders rarely or never losing money require deals to be structured accordingly. Prior to the advent of tighter capital adequacy rules and current macroeconomic impediments, there had already been a shift away from the increased pressure on lenders to accept greater levels of risk (for example, in the form of a more lenient covenant package, including hitherto \"unfashionable\" classes of investor within the borrowing base, or lending to funds whose managers have a shorter track record) and a move to increased scrutiny of the investor base and fund track records. Lenders and borrowers alike should remain vigilant in ensuring that they and their counterparties are sufficiently familiar with the product and its pitfalls and are being properly advised.\n\nThe macroeconomic climate has, unsurprisingly, impacted lenders. One notable change, as briefly mentioned below, is as a result of the \"stress capital buffer\" regime established by the Federal Reserve, which has required certain lenders to reduce their exposure to certain types of subscription-line financing. This, in conjunction with the US bank failures in 2023 that resulted in the insolvency of certain lenders active in the subscription line market, has caused a comparative lack of supply in the market.\n\nInnovation has nevertheless been prevalent, partly in response to market pressures. NAV facilities, despite carrying higher margins than subscription line facilities, are increasingly popular, not least for their flexibility, with certain sponsors turning to NAV loans to fund portfolio asset acquisitions where leveraged finance facilities are unavailable or priced unattractively. Separately, in 2023, Fitch Ratings finalised its rating criteria for subscription line facilities, a move that should boost supply in the market from, for example, regulated insurance companies that prefer to invest in rated debt instruments as they carry lower capital adequacy requirements.\n\nConcentration risk\n\nCentral to any lender's risk-management strategy will be how it approaches concentration risk and, more specifically, its exposure to specific investors, fund managers and fund sectors. Macroeconomic factors and tighter regulatory capital requirements have resulted in greater focus on managing this risk.\n\nIn relation to investors, lenders will often encounter the same entities across multiple funds (in particular, large institutional investors such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds). Over-exposure to such an investor will increase the risk that its default on its commitments will translate into a lender ultimately being out of pocket.\n\nEuropean Banking Authority Guidelines address, among other things, the aggregation of bank exposures, and in particular, exposures to a group of connected clients. The guidelines aim to help lenders identify all relevant connections among their clients, and specifically, two types of interconnection: (i) control relationships; and (ii) economic dependencies that lead to two or more customers being regarded as a single risk (subject to certain exceptions).\n\nA control relationship is deemed or likely to exist where, for example, an entity appears in the consolidated financial statements of a structure or holds, with respect to another entity, a majority of the voting rights, the right to appoint or remove management, or the right to otherwise exercise a dominant influence.\n\nAn economic dependency is deemed to exist where the financial difficulties or failure of an entity would be likely to lead to funding or repayment difficulties for another. For example: (i) where the source of funds to repay the loans of two or more borrowers is the same and there is no independent source of income to service the loans (for example, parallel funds with the same borrowing base); or (ii) where there are common investors or managers that do not meet the criteria of the control test (for example, there are common shareholders but no controlling shareholder, or they are managed on a unified basis).\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in the context of many fund structures, a lender may often be able to demonstrate an exception to the need for aggregation. In particular, this may be the case where the lender can show that:\n\n(i) there is no economic interdependence;\n\n(ii) the entity is bankruptcy remote - this will normally be the case for funds that are limited partnerships, as there should be no commingling of partnership and general partner assets (even where the general partner is general partner of multiple partnerships), as the general partner will only have access to its own assets on a bankruptcy of the general partner and not partnership assets (save in relation to partner liabilities owed to the general partner such as for fees); and/or\n\n(iii) there is structural de-linkage of the obligations of an entity from its parent.\n\nNevertheless, lenders are advised to exercise caution in relying on an exception because, in practice, in the case of affiliated funds or funds under common management, they are more likely to be \"connected\" and will be affected by the success and reputation of the other funds and their managers, irrespective of ring-fencing of assets.\n\nTo that end, it is essential that lenders assess fund functionaries' credentials whether they are managers, sponsors, or administrators. For experienced lenders active in the fund finance market, existing relationships with fund functionaries will enable lenders to have visibility on a given manager's track record and performance. Funds promoted by high-quality and established sponsors with a track record would be expected to be lower risk. However, for more recent entrants to the market, relevant information will be less readily available. It is therefore important for lenders to understand both the expertise and experience of the functionaries' key people in terms of portfolio management, investment criteria, business plan and financial model.\n\nAt the investor level, the most active lenders will generally hold significant information in relation to the investors and their participation in calls made by funds with which such lenders have an existing relationship. The more informed the lender when assessing whether to include or exclude an investor from a fund's borrowing base, the more reliable the borrowing base should arguably be. Many institutional investors are themselves subject to various reporting standards, including in relation to the provision of financial and other key investor and stakeholder information. Further, there is a wealth of publicly available information in relation to many pension funds and sovereign wealth funds including their financial accounts, their executive managers, their organisational structure and details as to their investment portfolio. In addition, lenders that act as account bank to fund entities can also leverage their overview of account activity.\n\nThere is a range of sophistication in the financial modelling carried out by lenders and the monitoring thereof. Newer entrants to the fund finance sector may not have the same resources available to them, and this can lead to different conclusions being drawn by such lenders in relation to the inclusion of investors in borrowing bases, which can be apparent on syndicated or club transactions.\n\nConducting a thorough review of all the investor side letters and expanding the covenant package in the facility agreement to include: (i) covenants relating to concentration risk; and/or (ii) concentration limits in the borrowing base provisions relating to the calculation of the borrowing base, will assist lenders in managing concentration exposures.\n\nAs above, with the increased use of automation, AI and data science in the financial services industry and more widely, lenders are becoming increasingly aware of the value of the data they hold in the course of, and for the purposes of, carrying out their business and understanding the dynamic between behavioural science and risk. By deploying new technology such as blockchain or other distributed ledger technology, innovation, and data analytics, lenders can use the data that they hold to build a clearer picture of market activity and, in turn, to determine and anticipate risks. The most obvious form of technology that could be used in this context is AI, which can be applied to conduct due diligence on funds, sponsors, and investors and keep up to date with sector trends and risks, valuations of fund assets, portfolio companies and net asset values (NAVs).\n\nA lender's success will be intrinsically linked to successfully identifying the parties to which it should extend financing. Lessons can be learnt from the tech giants in modelling and manipulating data to establish trends and map the behaviour of key market players, noting the confines of ensuring that this is done for proper purposes in accordance with the prevailing data protection regimes.\n\nIn a syndicated loan context, the more efficiently data is shared among the syndicate, the quicker the syndicate will be able to react to situations such as requests to increase facilities and amend terms. The developments in the syndicated market space, and Loan Market Association (LMA) initiatives to explore technology and automation, should mean that in the future, a common syntax is applied to syndicated lending, and a common standard can be applied that will improve the customer experience.\n\nLiquidity risk\n\nLiquidity is a perennial risk attached to lending and lenders will be familiar with the challenges this presents post-financial crisis, in the wake of the Basel III Framework and the introduction of liquidity ratios.\n\nThe revised regulatory landscape post-financial crisis required banking institutions to increase their capital and liquidity buffers,to help alleviate certain liquidity pressures and equip lenders to tolerate greater stress in financial markets, such as the continuing economic fallout of COVID-19, Brexit, the war in Ukraine and rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nHowever, recent equity market volatility, liquidity tightening, widening funding spreads, operational fails, and other challenges have put significant pressure on the financial markets. We are aware that certain bank lenders have taken steps to strengthen their liquidity and reporting capabilities and, in some cases, to monitor them more frequently. There is also the introduction of new capital rules by the Federal Reserve that will force certain US lenders to hold more capital relative to their \"risk-weighted assets\".\n\nGenerally, lenders may take a number of steps to manage exposure, including: (i) stress-testing the loan book; (ii) monitoring for concentrations of investors, functionaries and sectors as outlined above; (iii) considering the profile of investors with higher potential for exposure (including in terms of jurisdiction of domicile, ticket size, track record of making payments following drawdown requests, likelihood of themselves being a levered fund) and other reputational matters, noting that if a borrower is at the later stages of the fund cycle or the fund is fully committed, the lender may be less sensitive to the inclusion of such investors and borrowing base requirements may be relaxed accordingly; and (iv) considering whether there are any mismatches between the level and frequency of fund distributions made to investors and the level and frequency of capital calls made by the fund.\n\nIn terms of NAV and hybrid facilities, there is an additional liquidity risk to lenders, where assets provided as collateral for the facilities are overvalued or lose value and become insufficient to meet the borrower's obligations under the facility. Inability of lenders to challenge valuations could also play a role here.\n\nFacility information covenants, requiring borrowers to obtain robust and frequent asset valuations or requiring notification of any significant change in NAV, would assist the lender to monitor downstream valuations, in addition to the typical loan-to-value covenants and other financial covenants within facility documents.\n\nESG risks\n\nESG risks have been recognised as credit risks in their own right as early as late 2019 (if not earlier). Most lenders have adopted explicit ESG policies, and an increasing number of institutions have an ESG-dedicated resource in their credit risk teams. Lenders are therefore both increasingly aware of the risks and actively managing these risks as part of their usual assessments of credit risks. This should serve them well as the legal and regulatory framework increasingly moves to requiring more rigorous reporting standards in line with various taxonomies and local law requirements. As reporting standards and regulations continue to develop, we are likely to see ESG provisions given more prominence in the substantive fund constitutive documents, rather than left as an optional extra for investors to request in their side letters. As a result, more fund managers and lenders alike will need to ensure that a fund's performance is monitored against the ESG key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nA backdrop of high interest rates has seen a more cautious approach from some lenders concerned about regulatory risk, in particular after the US Securities and Exchange Commission fined BNY Mellon's investment adviser division for \"greenwashing\". This caution has also led potential borrowers of ESG-linked loans to switch away to conventional loans. The publication of the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) policy statement on \"Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR) and investment labels\" on 28 November 2023 demonstrates the direction of travel. It introduces a new \"anti-greenwashing\" rule that will apply to all FCA-authorised firms from 21 May 2024 and requires all claims made about the sustainability characteristics of a product or service to be clear, fair and not misleading. The policy statement also introduces four investment labels to help investors navigate the market (and the criteria that must be met in order to use an investment label), and new rules and guidance for firms marketing investment funds on the basis of their sustainability characteristics. While the majority of the rules apply to products offered to retail investors, the pre-contractual, ongoing product-level and entity-level disclosure requirements in Chapter 8 apply to products offered to retail and institutional investors. The direction of travel is therefore towards greater integrity in the ESG market, based on a regulatory framework that requires transparent sustainability standards that allow investors to assess whether investment opportunities are genuinely orientated towards sustainability.\n\nThe ability of lenders to access, analyse and rely on the integrity of information will be central to their ability to navigate what is a complex and changing landscape. Of the risks noted above, many of these may be managed and mitigated by real-time access to information (e.g. by way of blockchain or otherwise), as it adds colour to the facts, which are borne out through the financials, and facilitates better-quality decision-making by the lender. Further, regulatory rules that require borrowers to report sustainability information such as the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive should enable lenders to calculate more effectively their own sustainability metrics.\n\nThere are also other steps that lenders can introduce now to maximise the information they receive, such as placing the burden on fund functionaries to store, maintain and share management information, financial information and investor lists on systems that can be readily accessed such as private web portals or a private blockchain, for the lender to freely access. This would increase transparency, as such information could be made available in real time to lenders and assist in easing the burden of monitoring the performance of the loan.\n\nThis chapter has shown that, despite having a reputation as a low-risk product, the fund finance sphere is not without risk, but rather is a low-risk product due to the effective management of the risks present. In managing the current and evolving risks, we highlight the importance of engaging lender counsel at an early stage, both to conduct full diligence on the structure and to manage the documentation risk.\n\nAs the fund finance market continues to evolve, lenders will need to remain alert to the risks associated with lending in the market, notwithstanding the continued low default rate. In particular, the rapidly evolving macroeconomic picture may require the re-balancing of lending books or new approaches to risk migration.\n\nFootnotes",

    "title": "The ENRC Saga - Not Just A UK Concern - White Collar Crime, Anti-Corruption & Fraud - UK",
    "body": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nOn 21 December 2023, Mr Justice Waksman handed down his judgment in the second trial of the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) saga. The judgment, along with its earlier companions, is extraordinary in many ways and has been much written about as a result. We write to identify an additional level of concern with regards to the possibility of ENRC-like misconduct in the context of international investigations.\n\nThe background to this matter is well-documented in Mr Justice Waksman's comprehensive judgments, which we will not rehearse again here. It is enough to understand that between 2013 and 2023 ENRC was put under investigation by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after self-reporting potential criminal conduct in Kazakhstan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. Mr Justice Waksman found that this had occurred because ENRC's lawyer, Neil Gerrard of Dechert LLP, and the SFO had acted wrongfully in their conduct of the investigation. In short, the court found that Mr. Gerrard had disclosed information to the SFO and the press that was confidential and against ENRC's interests in circumstances when he had no authority to do so and that the SFO had inappropriately induced Mr. Gerrard to make some of those disclosures. The court expressly found that this criminal investigation would not have been initiated but for the misconduct of the SFO during the investigation.\n\nThis is not the first time that prosecutors in high-stakes criminal investigations have engaged in prosecutorial misconduct to advance their investigations. Nor will it be the last. This is also not the first time that defence lawyers representing the targets of those investigations have gone astray trying to meet the informational demands of prosecutors who control their clients' fate (and, again, it will not be the last). It is not simply a one-off problem.\n\nGiven the current trend of sprawling international investigations, it is also not a problem limited to the UK. Almost every international investigation of criminal misconduct now involves a \"joint task force\" of prosecutors being assembled representing different prosecutorial authorities and jurisdictions where criminal conduct might have occurred (and where it might be prosecuted). The classic foreign bribery facts in ENRC, for example, could have triggered investigations in Kazakhstan, Zambia or the DRC too. Assuming that certain facts could be established, it was also an appropriate subject for inquiry under the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nThis raises the question of whether information secured by prosecutors as a fruit of their misconduct in one jurisdiction can be used by prosecutors in another jurisdiction where no misconduct occurred and whether defence lawyers in a jurisdiction where no misconduct occurred can use the fact of misconduct in another jurisdiction as a defence in theirs. The answer to both questions, unfortunately, is \"maybe\". It turns on the laws in the various jurisdictions involved and the degree of the respective prosecutors' cooperation with each other. There is a real potential danger for clients here, because not every jurisdiction will have a Mr Justice Waksman holding misbehaving prosecutors and/or defence counsel to account.\n\nAs a result, it is essential that clients presented with such international investigations being run by multiple prosecutorial entities retain counsel expert in each of the jurisdictions involved. It would be unjust, for example, if information improperly obtained by US authorities for use in an FCPA prosecution somehow found its way to the UK where the rules against using improperly obtained evidence are considerably less strict.\n\nMr Justice Waksman's decisions to date in ENRC, along with the SFO's change in leadership, will have some deterrent effect to prevent such patently unfair results in the UK, but it will not set a precedent in any other jurisdiction. Instead, it will be up to robust and internationally skilled defence counsel to protect clients' rights elsewhere.\n\nThe full judgment can be read here.",

    "body": "Rates had been held in check last year as OPEC and its allies kept oil off the market. At the same time, a wider energy transition is meant do away with fossil fuels -- dimming the industry's outlook in the longer term.\n\nLongstanding warnings from the oil tanker industry that too few of the ships are being built are coming back to haunt the market after Houthi attacks on commercial shipping caused widespread diversions in global petroleum trades.\n\nJust two new supertankers are due to join the fleet in 2024 -- the fewest additions in almost four decades and about 90% below the yearly average this millennium. But after owners increasingly started to shun the southern Red Sea, the lack of new capacity is starting to bite: rates have seen spikes, and voyage durations are going up.\n\nRates had been held in check last year as OPEC and its allies kept oil off the market. At the same time, a wider energy transition is meant do away with fossil fuels -- dimming the industry's outlook in the longer term. But increased avoidance of the southern Red Sea is adding to the duration of trades that had already become elongated due to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\n\"The impact of the diversions can be seen every day in shipping in general and I would say crude oil and product tanker shipping\" specifically, Alexander Saverys, chief executive officer of Euronav NV, one of the largest pureplay owners, said on an earnings call earlier this month. Combined with few new deliveries and an aging fleet, the outlook for tankers is \"very positive.\"\n\nWhile other commercial vessels -- especially container ships -- started to avoid the Red Sea soon after the attacks started in November, oil and fuel tankers were slower to steer clear.\n\nThat all changed last month, after US and UK forces bombed Yemen in an effort to quell the incidents. However, the military interventions didn't stop the Houthis and instead have led to many of the world's top tanker owners staying away.\n\n\"The situation is tight in the tanker market, in particular for crude oil tankers,\" said Enrico Paglia, research manager at Banchero Costa, a shipping services firm. It \"will be even tighter in the future.\"\n\nThe tanker shortage comes as the efficiency of the global fleet is faltering. In addition to many vessels sailing around southern Africa instead of through the Red Sea and Suez Canal, a burgeoning dark fleet means that many ships are only available to certain customers.\n\nShipping is notoriously boom and bust. In 2020, when oil traders were stashing oil at sea on any vessel they could find, average earnings surged to about $100,000 a day, before ensuing production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led to a multiyear plunge.\n\nNow though, there are several bullish forces.\n\nOil deliveries have generally become more long-distance since a reshuffling of global oil flows following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shipments to Europe that would previously hop a few days across the Baltic Sea are now taking weeks to get to other parts of the world. The disruption in the Red Sea is adding even more to those sailing times.\n\nScant Orders\n\nVessel employment rates -- a measure of how highly used the tanker fleet is at any one time -- have risen by as much as 5% since ships began avoiding the waterway, according to Fotios Katsoulas, lead analyst for tanker shipping at S&P Global Commodity Insights.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea is changing the fundamentals in the market and it's acting in favor of the ship operators,\" he said. \"The sentiment is much better now.\"\n\nThe historically low order book is adding to the exuberance. Following the two supertankers that are joining the fleet this year, there will be only five in 2025, according to data from Banchero Costa. That compares with 42 ships delivered in 2022.\n\nWhile there has been a recent uptick in orders, it takes years for them to arrive, with shipyards currently full of container vessels that were ordered during the pandemic, as well as requests for liquefied natural gas carriers.\n\nStill, there are some reasons for caution. OPEC+ is continuing to curtail output in order to support oil prices, creating a drag on the volume of oil at sea, which is below the level it was at a year ago. And high freight rates can naturally correct themselves by making it too expensive for barrels to sail over longer distances, ultimately curtailing tanker demand.\n\nOwners are also opportunistic and will sometimes try to switch construction orders for new vessels that are more profitable.\n\nBut equity analysts are mostly bullish about tanker owners.\n\nFrontline Plc, the world's largest listed pureplay tanker owner, has 12 buy recommendations from the 16 companies that cover it. International Seaways Inc., another of the top 10, has 11 buy recommendations from its 11 analysts.\n\n\"Considering the limited order book, a quickly aging fleet, the amount of tonnage that is already over-age and the impact of the environmental regulations in the sector, the good market for tanker owners is here to stay for the foreseeable future,\" said Banchero Costa's Paglia.",

We recognise that as regionally-focussed investors we have a huge part to play in ensuring our industry can continue to contribute positively to our economy and society. We're so proud of the number of national and international businesses that we have supported that are based in the UK regions, which is why we're committed to using our voice; working alongside Government and Education; and delivering sustainable returns for our stakeholders - demonstrating the attractiveness and the power of the regions.\"\n\nRachel Reeves said: \"The private equity and venture capital sector is incredibly important for fulfilling our mission to grow the economy. The work that you do ensuring that businesses can attract fast growing capital and the turning around businesses is vital for economic growth.\"\n\nOne of the issues raised with Reeves was the importance of broadening pension fund access to private equity and venture capital.\n\nMembers also used the meeting to highlight the value of their work in growing and supporting British businesses to the Shadow Chancellor, and deploying the £145bn of dry powder capital that is available to be invested in the next 3-5 years.\n\nThe Shadow Chancellor emphasised her commitment to boosting pension investment in private capital in order to drive better returns for savers and growth for British businesses.\n\nPolicy conclusions from the BVCA's new Investment Commission were also discussed, as well as key areas in Labour's recent financial services review, including: Making the UK a world leader in sustainable finance; Labour's plan to reinvigorate capital markets; Pooling LGPS and reviewing the state of pensions in the UK.\n\nProjecting a strong voice for the region's homegrown Northern investment businesses is one of the founding principles behind the first Rainmakers Conference to be held at The Point conferencing facilities at the Emirates Old Trafford on March 20, 2024 and organised by TheBusinessDesk.com.\n\nThe conference will be an opportunity to not only celebrate the contribution from funds raised and deals created, but also to look to the future at the challenges ahead.\n\nThe event has been forged alongside the key partners from private equity and specialist financiers in the North, and backed by elite teams of advisory businesses, the event will bring together funders, entrepreneurs, business leaders to focus on opportunities and challenges.",

    "body": "New Delhi, Feb 26: Prime Minister Narendra Modi affirmed to transform India into a Global Export Hub as he inaugurated the global textile event, Bharat Tex 2024 at Delhi's Bharat Mandapam on Monday.\n\n\"We have a firm belief that we will transform India into a 'Global Export Hub'. In the last decade, we have added another new dimension to Vocal for Local. Today, public movements of Vocal for Local and Local to Global are going on in the entire country,\" PM Modi said while addressing the textile event.\n\n\"We have resolved to transform Bharat into a 'Viksit Rashtra' in the next 25 years. Four important pillars of Viksit Bharat are poor, youth, farmers and women. And notably, the textile sector of Bharat is connected with all these pillars,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nThe Prime Minister said that the government's consistent efforts are giving rise to increased foreign investments in India's textile sector.\n\n\"Today, the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the textile sector has doubled from what it was before 2014,\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted the efforts of the government in building the textile sector, adding that it is focused on quality control.\n\n\"The positive impacts resulting from the efforts of a stable and visionary government on the textile sector can well be seen. In 2014, the valuation of the textile market of India was less than Rs 7 lakh crores, today, it has crossed Rs 12 lakh crores,\" the Prime Minister outlined.\n\n\"During the last 10 years, there has been a 25 per cent rise in the production of yarn, fabric, and apparel. The government is very much focused on quality control in the textile sector,\" he added.\n\nPM Modi further emphasised how Khadi played a role in strengthening the women workforce in the industry.\n\n\"Out of every 10 garment makers, 7 are women and in handloom, it is even more. Apart from textile, Khadi has also given new strength to the women of our country,\" he said.\n\n\"I can say that whatever efforts we have made in the last 10 years have made Khadi a means of both development and employment,\" the Prime Minister added.\n\nToday in India, along with scale, we are also laying great emphasis on skill in this sector, he said.\n\n\"The network of the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) has reached 19 institutes in the country. Nearby weavers and artisans are also being connected to these institutions,\" PM Modi said.\n\nThe Prime Minister further emphasised 'Kasturi Cotton' launched by the government, which is anticipated to create an identity for India.\n\n\"Today, India is one of the largest producers of cotton, jute, and silk in the world. Lakhs of farmers are engaged in this work,\" he said.\n\n\"Today the government is supporting lakhs of cotton farmers, purchasing lakhs of quintals of cotton from them. The Kasturi Cotton launched by the government is going to be a big step towards creating India's own identity,\" he added.\n\nBharat Tex 2024, one of the largest-ever global textile events held in India, marks a significant milestone in promoting India's rich textile heritage and fostering collaboration within the industry.\n\nSpeaking on occasion, Union Minister Piyush Goyal highlighted the remarkable growth of Bharat Mandapam since its inauguration just seven months ago.\n\nHe emphasised the need to expand the infrastructure to accommodate the increasing demand, suggesting the initiation of Phase 2 at both Bharat Mandapam and YashoBhoomi.\n\n\"It has been only 7 months since this Bharat Mandapam was inaugurated by PM Modi on July 26, 2023 and in just seven months, this place and YashoBhoomi have started falling short of space. Now, we need to start Phase 2 at both locations as early as possible, which you can inaugurate in your third term,\" the Union Minister said.\n\nBharat Tex 2024 serves as a platform to showcase the iconic handloom and handicraft traditions of various states, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nUttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have been designated as the 'Partner States' for the event, underscoring their significant contributions to India's textile sector.\n\nAdditionally, Gujarat, Telangana, and Madhya Pradesh have joined as 'Supporting Partner States,' further enriching the diversity of textile offerings at the event.\n\nThe premier global textile event also features state pavilions from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Assam, highlighting the vibrant textile ecosystems across different regions of India.\n\nBharat Tex 2024 brings together key stakeholders, including textile manufacturers, artisans, designers, and policymakers, to explore opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and sustainable growth in the textile industry.\n\nThe event not only celebrates India's rich textile heritage but also underscores the country's position as a global leader in the textile and apparel industry.\n\nWith its diverse range of traditional and contemporary textiles, Bharat Tex 2024 offers a unique platform for showcasing India's craftsmanship, creativity, and innovation to the world.\n\nThe event reaffirms the government's commitment to promoting the growth and competitiveness of the textile industry, thereby contributing to India's economic development and cultural heritage preservation.",

    "body": "(Reuters) - Dutch postal operator PostNL on Monday forecast 2024 operating profit above last year's level at the mid-point of its range, as it expects growth in Asian e-commerce, higher prices and strict cost controls to help offset increasing labour costs.\n\nThe company, which delivers parcels and letters across Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, sees normalised earnings before interest and taxes of between 80 million and 110 million euros ($87 million and $119 million) this year.\n\nIt confirmed its preliminary 2023 figures for normalised operating earnings of 92 million euros and reported annual revenue of 3.17 billion euros, in line with market expectations according to a company-provided consensus.\n\nPostNL also sees double-digit percentage growth in international parcel volumes this year, driven by growing parcel traffic from Asian online shops. That should result in 2024 parcel growth of 7% to 10% for the whole group.\n\n\"We remain confident in the future growth in the e-commerce market, underpinned by the positive trend in online penetration, while acknowledging the ongoing uncertainty in the economic environment,\" CEO Herna Verhagen said in a statement.\n\nThe company plans to boost its market presence by retaining existing e-commerce clients and acquiring new ones in both Asia and Europe.\n\nPostNL said it had delivered 95 million parcels during the typically busy end of year holiday quarter, up 0.9% from a year earlier, with continued strong growth from international customers.\n\nIt will propose a dividend of 0.09 euro per share for 2023, down from a payout of 0.16 euro a year earlier.",

    "body": "Funafuti [Tuvalu], February 26 (ANI): Tuvalu's parliamentary members have selected former Attorney General Feleti Teo as the Pacific Island nation's new prime minister following a general election that recently brought the country's relationship with Taiwan into focus, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nTuvalu's government announced on Monday that Teo, the sole candidate nominated by his 15 lawmaker colleagues, was declared elected without a vote.\n\nTeo's elevation to the position of prime minister comes in the wake of the departure of his pro-Taiwan predecessor, Kausea Natano, who lost his seat in the January 26 election. Natano had advocated for Tuvalu, home to around 11,200 people, to maintain official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, as reported by Al Jazeera.\n\nThe swearing-in ceremony for Prime Minister Teo and his cabinet is scheduled for later this week. The political transition has raised questions about Tuvalu's stance on Taiwan, as well as its broader international relationships, including a defense and migration deal with Australia signed in November.\n\nAustralian PM Anthony Albanese congratulated Teo on getting elected as Prime Minister of Tuvalu.\n\n\"Warm congratulations to the Hon Feleti Teo on his election as Prime Minister of Tuvalu. Australia deeply values our relationship with Tuvalu, in the spirit of the Falepili Union. Tuvalu can count on Australia's support and I look forward to working with PM Teo,\" he said in a post on X.\n\nFormer finance minister Seve Paeniu, a potential leader, had suggested that the new government should debate the issue of diplomatic recognition of Taiwan or China. This raised concerns in Taiwan, especially following Nauru's recent decision to sever diplomatic ties with Taipei in favour of Beijing.\n\nIn addition to diplomatic considerations, there were calls by some Tuvalu lawmakers to review a comprehensive defence and migration agreement with Australia. The pact allows Canberra to oversee Tuvalu's police, port, and telecommunication cooperation with other nations, offering a defence guarantee and migration opportunities to citizens affected by rising sea levels, a crucial concern in the Pacific region. The deal was perceived as a move to counter China's increasing influence as an infrastructure provider in the Pacific Islands.\n\nTeo, educated in New Zealand and Australia, holds the distinction of being Tuvalu's first attorney general and boasts extensive experience as a senior official in the fisheries industry, a significant revenue source for the region.\n\nSimon Kofe, a Tuvalu lawmaker, congratulated Teo, noting, \"It is the first time in our history that a Prime Minister has been nominated unopposed.\"Persistent adverse weather conditions had delayed the announcement of the new prime minister, as several lawmakers were stranded on Tuvalu's outer islands, unable to reach the capital, Al Jazeera reported.
