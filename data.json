    "body": "TORONTO -- Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland says the federal government will cap the annual alcohol excise tax increase on beer, spirits and wine at two per cent for an additional two years.\n\nThe alcohol excise tax had been set to rise on April 1 by 4.7 per cent, tied to inflation, but Freeland announced today that the increase is being capped at the lower rate.\n\nShe also announced some tax relief for local craft breweries by cutting the excise duty rate on the first 15,000 hectolitres of beer in half for two years.\n\nShe says Canada's small craft brewers are among the finest in the world and are an important contributor to the economy.\n\nRestaurants Canada is applauding the move, saying the financial relief will give operators a chance to catch their breath as they try to cope with inflation and bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Canadian Taxpayers Federation says it is good to see some relief, but the government shouldn't be raising alcohol taxes at all.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 9, 2024.",

    "title": "PM Changed Perception About Democracy: Jitendra Singh",
    "body": "Jammu- Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday lavished praises on Prime Minister Narendra Modi for changing the work culture and perception about democracy by undertaking all round development in the country.\n\nSingh, the minister of state in the Prime Minister's office, was addressing a public rally after inaugurating the agri start-up exhibition in Doda district, which is part of his Udhampur parliamentary constituency.\n\nThis was the minister's first visit to Doda after he was given a ticket for the third time to fight the Lok Sabha elections from the constituency. He had won the last general elections by a margin of over 3.5 lakh votes.\n\n\"It is a matter of happiness that Modi has been able to change the work culture and perception about democracy by undertaking all round development and ensuring delivery of schemes as and where needed,\" Singh said.\n\nHe said the government has reignited those hopes which had faded and rekindled aspirations among the youth who had resigned to their fate due to the prevailing work environment.\n\n\"All the works have been carried out with an urge to serve the general public from the core of the heart and to provide the benefits rising above the politics of caste, creed and religion. The prime minister has sought to create a new work culture in politics which our successors will be bound to follow,\" he said.\n\nSingh alleged that earlier governments neglected the entire region of erstwhile Doda district and created social strife by playing politics of division, whereas under Prime Minister Modi \"we ensured equitable development and restored communal harmony\".\n\n\"Analysts will find it difficult to answer as to why Doda remained backward despite the fact that after independence, there was not a single occasion when Doda did not have its representative both in the Union Cabinet as well as in the Jammu and Kashmir Cabinet,\" he said.\n\nHe said Doda has today emerged on the world map because Bhaderwah has given the world lavender and purple revolution which were exhibited in the Republic Day parade at New Delhi and Modi spoke in detail about it in \"Mann Ki Baat\".\n\nUnder Modi, the minister said he has also sought to follow a different political culture of reaching out equally to all sections of people regardless of religion or caste.\n\n\"The people of Doda belt are traditionally peace loving and patriotic, and they had refused to migrate even during the peak of militancy,\" he said.\n\nHe said new National Highway 244 from Khillani to Sudhmahadev touching Goha Kalota, approval of Chattergala tunnel and Kaljugar tunnel, series of hydropower projects and airport under Udaan in Kishtwar, Centrally funded Medical College in Doda and High Altitude Medicine Plant in Bhaderwah, all happened in last 10 years.\n\n\"A large number of projects brought to the Doda region in the last 10 years have not only brought about transformation but were also meant to change the mindset,\" he said, adding various welfare schemes launched not only meant social and economic transformation but also aroused several semi-conscious aspirations, particularly in the youth which had got buried due to dismay and pessimism of the past.\n\nSingh underlined that road connectivity, power supply and medical facilities have been improved in Doda in the last 10 years.\n\nHe said this constituency holds distinction as being the lone Lok Sabha constituency where there are three medical colleges, namely in Doda, Kathua and Udhampur.\n\nLater talking to reporters, he expressed confidence of the NDA led by Modi crossing the 400 mark in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.",

    "title": "Contractor defends work on ArriveCan app, says conflict concerns were addressed",
    "body": "A company that worked on the ArriveCan app is defending its integrity and asserts steps were taken to address conflict-of-interest concerns related to its founder, who recently went to work for the Department of National Defence.\n\nDalian Enterprises Inc. said David Yeo made the appropriate conflict-of-interest filing, resigned as a director and officer and put his company shares in a blind trust since its main customer is the government of Canada.\n\nYeo also agreed not to participate in any direct or indirect work that the company was doing for the Defence Department, said a spokesperson for the company.\n\nThe spokesperson said in a statement that from 2002 until September 2023, Yeo, a former military member, \"was not an employee of the government of Canada in any capacity.\"\n\nHe \"only provided IT professional services on a contract basis through Dalian to the Department of National Defence,\" the statement said.\n\nIt's the first time the company has publicly responded after CTV News reported last month on Yeo's employment status and Dalian's previous work on ArriveCan. The government paid the company $7.9 million as part of the app's nearly $60-million overall cost.\n\nFollowing that report, the Defence Department announced that Yeo was suspended and that it had launched an internal investigation.\n\nA week ago, Public Services and Procurement Canada announced it was suspending the company's security status \"in response to information that recently came to light.\"\n\nIt said that the company would no longer be able to work on federal contracts or participate in new procurement opportunities.\n\nREAD MORE: Info watchdog probing record destruction allegations related to ArriveCan app\n\nOn Friday, the Defence Department would only say the investigation is still ongoing.\n\nDalian's spokesperson said Yeo would not be available for an interview.\n\nWhen he began working for the government in September, the company's work for ArriveCan had long since concluded, the spokesperson said.\n\nDalian, along with Coradix Technology Consulting, were authorized in August of 2019 to work on various Canada Border Services Agency projects.\n\nThat later included the ArriveCan app, which has since fallen under intense scrutiny for its bloated cost.\n\nCoradix has also been suspended from government work.\n\nWhen Yeo testified before a House of Commons committee in October, he spoke to his integrity. He didn't mention his current employment and wasn't asked about it.\n\n\"During my 36-year career with the Canadian army, which included deployments to Afghanistan and the Middle East, I was held to the highest levels of integrity, and of course, I continue to conduct myself in this manner today,\" Yeo said.\n\nHe was recently invited to speak to the committee again, after the department announced its investigation.\n\nEarlier this week, Canada's auditor General Karen Hogan told MPs at a committee hearing about Yeo's connection to the Department of National Defence.\n\nShe said that connection wasn't detected as part of her audit of the ArriveCan project because the Defence Department was not involved in the development of the app.\n\nBut she said employees' full disclosure is \"essential\" so that supervisors can assess if any outside work is incompatible with the person's job, and \"whether it might have an impact on their ability to carry out their duties in an objective and fair manner.\"\n\n\"The disclosure is maybe not always happening, and when the disclosure happens you can take the measures that you need,\" Hogan said.\n\nHogan said there have been times in her own office when employees disclosed certain information and their employer is \"fine with it.\" Other times, that's not the case. But it's up to the supervisor to decide, she said.\n\nThe Treasury Board Secretariat said on Friday it does not have centralized records on the number of government of Canada employees that are engaged in outside employment.\n\nDalian said since the company was founded in 2002, it has been regularly audited by what is now known as Indigenous Services Canada.\n\nThat department oversees compliance requirements for Indigenous-owned businesses when it comes to certain procurement opportunities.\n\n\"In the most recent such audit, conducted December 2023 to February 2024, ISC confirmed that Dalian successfully met (Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business) criteria,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMickey Djuric, The Canadian Press",

    "title": "Historic Las Vegas Strip property closed and set for auction",
    "body": "The Pink Elephant at the Diamond Inn Motel on the Las Vegas Strip on Nov. 25, 2019.\n\nThe old Las Vegas Strip has nearly disappeared, and many of the remaining ties to its past are being torn down or slated for a wrecking ball.\n\nThat's because the price of land and the cost of operating on the Strip are so high that properties that once made financial sense have become obsolete. Smaller hotels and casinos can simply no longer justify their existence if a megaproperty can replace them.\n\nRelated: Iconic Las Vegas Strip resort casino going out with a bang\n\nHawaiian Marketplace, a longtime Strip fixture offering kitschy shops and food stalls, was purchased and demolished in 2023 to make way for a massive new 95-foot-tall retail and restaurant complex. A hotel and casino have been rumored, but not confirmed, for the property.\n\nAnother small-scale operation, Casino Royale, nestled in the heart of the area dominated by Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International, (MGM) will also soon be demolished. Its small casino and 152-room Best Western will make way for a huge tower.\n\nWhereas the Strip used to be dotted with motels, it's now dominated by megaresorts. And one of the last holdouts, a nod to Las Vegas' past with an iconic Pink Elephant greeting visitors, has closed and the process of auctioning off the property has begun.\n\nA Las Vegas legend has seen its last day\n\nCaesars' Flamingo, which was built in 1946, currently stands as the oldest resort casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The Tropicana, for which demolition is set to begin in April, is more than a decade younger, having been built in 1957.\n\nThe Diamond Inn Motel, which has been closed since last year, represents a piece of Las Vegas Strip history that will cease to exist when it gets torn down.\n\n\"Built in 1940 the Diamond Inn Motel (then it was called the Desert Isle Motel) is one of the oldest buildings still standing on the strip, which several decades ago the strip was called Arrowhead Highway/Highway 91,\" the company said on its website. \"The first hotel/casino built on the strip was called the El Rancho Vegas Hotel & Casino built in 1941.\"\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\nIn those days, most of the casinos operating on the Strip did not have attached hotels.\n\n\"Later in the '40's and 50's, dozens of motels were built next door, the Mirage, Lone Palm, Desert Rose and many others that were the high points of Old Vegas with their glittering neon signs,\" the website said.\n\nLas Vegas Strip's Pink Elephant deserves a better fate\n\nDiamond Inn is being auctioned off by J.P. King, a company that specialized in real estate auctions. A minimum bid of $12.5 million has been set for the property, which offers 1.36 acres of land with 237 feet of Las Vegas Strip frontage.\n\n\"Zoned H-1 for hotel/casino use, with approved buildable heights reaching skyward between 406 to 505 feet, the estate promises a future as dazzling as its past,\" the auction company says on its website.\n\n\"It boasts more road frontage than the nearby Paris, MGM Grand, and Venetian, and sits directly opposite Mandalay Bay, Luxor, and Excalibur, placing it at the heart of Las Vegas' ceaseless energy. The Diamond Inn is walking distance to all major attractions, making it an excellent and rare investment opportunity for a world-class resort in a prime location.\"\n\nThe property went up for bid on March 7 and the auction includes a unique piece of Las Vegas history: Diamond Inn's Pink Elephant statue.\n\n\"The pink elephant came from Disney World, probably in the 50's. He used to trumpet loudly, but the noise caused some accidents. Because of that, the county made the owner take the sound mechanism out,\" Diamond Inn said.\n\nJ.P. King will close the auction on March 14.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99",

Verstappen came into the pits for a tire change and after the restart easily passed Lando Norris -- who hadn't stopped -- to retake the lead.\n\nPerez had a five-second penalty because Red Bull released him from a pit stop into the path of another car, but that didn't matter since he finished far ahead of Leclerc.\n\nEighteen-year-old British driver Oliver Bearman was seventh for Ferrari in his first F1 race, one day after being called up as an emergency replacement for Carlos Sainz Jr., who needed an operation to treat appendicitis.\n\nOscar Piastri took fourth for McLaren, with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso fifth and George Russell sixth for Mercedes.\n\nBehind Bearman in seventh, McLaren's Lando Norris held off Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in a fight for eighth place. Nico Hulkenberg was 10th for Haas' first point in F1 since the Singapore Grand Prix in September.\n\nVerstappen's second win of the season followed speculation over his future at Red Bull.\n\nVerstappen had suggested Friday that he might reconsider his relationship with the team if his mentor Helmut Marko were to leave Red Bull, but Marko told German broadcaster Sky Sport on Saturday that he was staying.\n\nThe team's parent company last week dismissed a complaint of alleged misconduct by Red Bull team principal Horner toward a team employee.",

    "title": "49ers Linked to Polarizing Quarterback",
    "body": "If the New England Patriots trade quarterback Mac Jones to the San Francisco 49ers, the former No. 15 pick has an outside shot to test wild hypothesis.\n\nNFL Network's James Palmer told DNVR Sports that several coaches at the NFL Combine expressed that Jones could have won multiple Lombardi Trophies with the 49ers already. The 49ers are established at quarterback with Brock Purdy after a carousel of former Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo followed by Trey Lance.\n\n\"They think if he [Kyle Shanahan] took Mac at three, they would have won multiple Super Bowls by now,\" Palmer said on the podcast.\n\nSan Francisco ironically picked before the Patriots in that 2021 draft when Lance went at No. 3 to San Francisco followed by Jones at No. 15 to New England. Lance didn't pan out, and the 49ers traded him to the Dallas Cowboys before the 2023 season.\n\nJones didn't pan out in New England as things cratered in 2023. However, the 49ers arguably offered a stronger supporting cast on offense than the Patriots during the past three seasons, which may have made the difference. Since that 2021 draft, the 49ers have reached three NFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl.\n\nIf the Patriots send Jones to San Francisco, it's likely for a late round pick. San Francisco has a potential need at backup quarterback with Sam Darnold poised to test free agency.\n\nPurdy played in all 17 games last season, but he sustained a season-ending elbow injury in the NFC Championship Game the year before. In addition, the 49ers have dealt with a plethora of quarterback injuries in recent years despite two Super Bowl appearances and four NFC title games in five years.\n\nSan Francisco could be among the teams that \"have been calling\" the Patriots about Jones. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport broke the news on Friday that the Patriots are looking at trading Jones and have been in contact with other teams.\n\nMultiple teams with quarterback needs could send a late-round pick to New England for Jones' services -- most likely as a backup. MassLive's Mark Daniels reported that a fourth or fifth round pick is realistic compensation for Jones.\n\nLas Vegas also appears poised to release Garoppolo after a PED suspension after the season. He will miss two games next fall because of the suspension.\n\nJones won't cost any of the aforementioned teams much money as he is due to make $4.95 million in 2024. The Patriots meanwhile could add depth at a needed position in exchange for Jones.",

    "title": "Royal Caribbean shares key safety news for passengers",
    "body": "CocoCay offers beaches, a pool, and added-fee attractions like a hot air balloon.\n\nWhen you book a cruise, the cruise line reserves the right to change the itinerary at any time. That's because weather, political unrest, and a variety of other concerns can force a cruise line to change its plans.\n\nIn some cases, a medical emergency might for a cruise ship to change its route and that could impact a planned stop. A recent sailing of Celebrity Cruise's Silhouette, for example, had to make an added stop to offload a passenger with a medical crisis. That caused the ship to land in San Juan in late afternoon rather than early morning.\n\nRelated: Carnival Cruise Line makes a controversial onboard-rule change\n\nBecause of the change, most planned excursions were canceled and refunded. That was a disappointment for some passengers, but it's not likely that too many people booked the trip because it stopped in San Juan.\n\nIn other cases, Royal Caribbean, Carnival Cruise Line, Norwegian, and other cruise brands have to make choices that will upset passengers. All cruise lines, for example, have not been sailing in Israel because of the ongoing war there. That's at least something passengers who booked on ships that would have made stops there know well before their sailing.\n\nUnplanned cancellations happen all the time and that often has passengers following the news in various countries to see if their port stop may get cancelled. One popular Royal Caribbean (RCL) destination has been in the news and that has a lot of passengers asking if their stop at a fan-favorite destination might get canceled.\n\nRoyal Caribbean deals with political unrest\n\nRoyal Caribbean has become known for its private destinations in the Caribbean. Perfect Day at CocoCay has become the standard for cruise line private islands and a favorite destination of many passengers.\n\nSome passengers, however, prefer the cruise line's other Caribbean private stop, Labadee, Haiti. That area, which is a peninsula, not an island, has not been developed as much as CocoCay. It's more of a traditional cruise ship private destination offering beaches, an inflatable water park, a BBQ area, bars, and a roller coaster-like ride that takes people through the treetops.\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\nLabadee lacks CocoCay's pools, its added-fee beach club, and its new adult-only area. To some cruisers, that makes it more pure and it's a favored spot for many.\n\nMany Royal Caribbean passengers, however, have been worried about whether their Labadee stop will be canceled due to the political unrest in the country and the U.S. State Department's emphatic warning on the area:\n\n\"Do not travel to Haiti due to kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, and poor health care infrastructure. On July 27, 2023, the Department of State ordered the departure of family members of U.S. government employees and non-emergency U.S. government employees. U.S. citizens in Haiti should depart Haiti as soon as possible by commercial or other privately available transportation options, in light of the current security situation and infrastructure challenges.\"\n\nRoyal Caribbean shares good news (and a warning)\n\nRoyal Caribbean has canceled port stops to Labadee in the past due to the ongoing unrest in the country. That's not happening now, according to a report from Matt Hochberg of the Royal Caribbean Blog, which is not affiliated with the cruise line.\n\n\"While Labadee is indeed in Haiti, it's a private port only accessible to Royal Caribbean. In fact, the area of Labadee is secured and monitored to ensure the safety of cruise passengers and crew members,\" he wrote.\n\nBasically, while Labadee is technically Haiti, it's actually a remote area that's more than a six-hour drive from Port Au Prince, the country's capital. Visitors to the Royal Caribbean island cannot go on excursions that take them outside the area controlled by the cruise line.\n\nA spokesperson for the cruise line did issue.a broad safety warning in a statement to the media.\n\n\"The safety of our guests and crew is our top priority. Our global security teams are closely monitoring the situation in the area. At all times, we remind guests to remain aware of their surroundings while ashore and follow all State Department guidelines. Should any changes be required, guests will be notified directly,\" the cruise line shared.\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99",

    "body": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Thursday that in the first two months of 2024, the transit trade volume through the Suez Canal dropped by 50% from a year earlier, while trade volume through the Panama Canal fell by 32% due to Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and drought, respectively, Azernews reports, citing Anadolu Agency.\n\nRecent disruptions in key shipping routes have hindered global trade, the IMF said in a blog post.\n\nAttacks by Yemen's Houthis on vessels in the Red Sea area have reduced traffic through the Suez Canal, which typically handles about 15% of global maritime trade.\n\nConsequently, some shipping companies have rerouted their vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, leading to extended delivery times of over 10 days on average and negatively impacting companies with limited inventories.\n\nThe article noted that trade volume in the Cape of Good Hope increased by 74% during the same period.\n\nTrade volume in the Panama Canal also decreased by almost 32% compared with the prior year.\n\nA severe drought at the Panama Canal has forced authorities to impose significant restrictions on daily ship transits since October last year, slowing down maritime trade at a critical point where about 5% of global maritime trade passes through.\n\nThe article said there was a 6.7% decrease in voyages to 70 ports in sub-Saharan Africa in the first two months of the year compared to the previous year and the corresponding declines for the European Union and the Middle East and Central Asia were 5.3%.\n\nThese declines likely reflect the temporary effects of prolonged shipping times.\n\n\"If continued, the ripple effects of these disruptions could temporarily hamper some supply chains in affected countries and cause upward pressure on inflation (in part due to higher shipping costs),\" it warned.",

    "title": "Analysts take another look at troubled NY bank",
    "body": "When we last left New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) , the troubled financial services company's shares were surging.\n\nThe regional bank's stock has been on a wild ride over the last few days, tumbling more than 40% in one session and jumping as much as 16% the following day.\n\nBut the good times didn't last long and and shares were down again on March 8, sliding 7% to $3.40 in late afternoon trading.\n\nThe turmoil began with a report in The Wall Street Journal that said the company was looking to raise new capital to shore up its balance sheet.\n\nEarlier, the New York Community Bancorp had stunned investors on Jan. 31 by reporting an unexpected fourth-quarter loss, causing the stock to tumble to its lowest level since 1997.\n\nEnter former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and his firm, Liberty Strategic Capital, which is leading a $1 billion rescue of the company.\n\nWith the new capital plan, Mnuchin will join the NYCB board along with Joseph Otting, who was named the new CEO.\n\nOtting, a former U.S. comptroller of the currency, has longtime ties to Mnuchin, as both men served in the Donald Trump Administration.\n\nAnalyst: 'heavy lifting ahead'\n\nDuring a call with analysts on March 7, Otting said the bank is seeing interest from non-bank bidders for some of its loans and will outline a new business plan next month, Reuters reported, while disclosing deposits fell 7%.\n\nOtting and Non-Executive Chair Alessandro DiNello, who had been named the bank's CEO on Feb. 29, told analysts that they would soon unveil a new business plan and had closely scrutinized the bank's books, and provided insight on deposit flows.\n\nRelated: Analysts reveal new Broadcom price targets after mixed earnings\n\n\"I've spent a fair amount of time getting to know the organization from afar and then a significant amount of time conducting due diligence on the portfolio and the balance sheet,\" Otting said, noting that NYCB had a \"strong liquidity position.\"\n\nDespite Otting's reassurances, analysts were still taking a cautious stance with the bank.\n\nBank of America cut its price target for NYCB from $4.25 from $5 while keeping a neutral rating.\n\nIn a research note entitled \"Heavy lifting ahead,\" the bank's analysts said that \"significant uncertainty stemming from the need for additional credit reserves, potential for an external capital raise, abrupt management changes pose downside risk to the stock.\"\n\n\"While we see potential downside risks to our forecast, we believe that current valuation is already pricing-in a range of negative outcomes, keeping us at a neutral rating,\" the firm said.\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\nBank of America said that the capital infusion and the experience of the incoming investor base should afford some time to engineer \"a thoughtful turnaround.\"\n\n\"However, there is heavy lifting ahead and the shape, timing and the probability of success of any potential turnaround remains an unknown,\" the firm said.\n\nWedbush analysts kept their underperform rating and $3 price target for the bank's shares.\n\n\"Our takeaways from the deal remain largely the same: this is a very dilutive, but necessary deal for NYCB in order to shore up its capital base and reassure depositors,\" the firm said.\n\nAnalyst calls for 'cautious approach'\n\nDespite the recent credit downgrades from Fitch and Moody's, Wedbush said NYCB maintained that it was able to obtain waivers to maintain custodial deposit levels.\n\nThe firm said its underperform rating is based on the bank's high exposure to NYC rent-regulated multifamily loans, which the firm believes are under stress and represent 22% of NYCB's total loans.\n\nMore Wall Street Analysts:\n\nAnalyst who correctly

Point also cut its price target on NYCB to $4.50 from $5, while keeping a neutral rating.\n\nThe firm cited the significant increase in diluted shares resulting from NYCB's capital raise as a primary factor for the adjustment, according to Investing.com.\n\nCompass Point also pointed out changes to the forecasted core earnings per share for fiscal years 2024 and 2025, adjusting them to 19 cents and 40 cents, respectively, from the earlier estimates of 42 cents and 80 cents.\n\nDespite the lower price target, the firm acknowledged the potential for upside but also recognizes increased risks to their target and core earnings-per-share estimates.\n\nCompass Point suggested a cautious approach in the near term, considering the uncertainties and challenges that NYCB faces\n\nRBC Capital lowered the firm's price target on NYCB to $5 from $7 and kept a sector perform rating on the shares after the bank announced an equity raise and reduced its quarterly dividend to 1 cent per share from 5 cents.\n\nThe equity raise \"meaningfully\" improves the bank's capital ratios and confidence in the company, and also adds the ability to increase loan loss reserves, which is likely to be

I felt really good with the car,\" Verstappen said.\n\nThe Dutch driver won easily ahead of his teammate Sergio Perez.

Verstappen came into the pits for a tire change and after the restart easily passed Lando Norris -- who hadn't stopped -- to retake the lead.\n\nPerez had a five-second penalty because Red Bull released him from a pit stop into the path of another car, but that didn't matter since he finished far ahead of Leclerc.\n\nEighteen-year-old British driver Oliver Bearman was seventh for Ferrari in his first F1 race, one day after being called up as an emergency replacement for Carlos Sainz Jr., who needed an operation to treat appendicitis.\n\nOscar Piastri took fourth for McLaren, with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso fifth and George Russell sixth for Mercedes.\n\nBehind Bearman in seventh, McLaren's Lando Norris held off Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in a fight for eighth place.

    "title": "Stock market today: Wall Street falls from its record after a turbulent day - ExBulletin",
    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) Wall Street retreated from its record high Friday after a tough day of trading, at least temporarily halting its huge rally since Halloween.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.7% from its all-time high set the day before. It initially rose after mixed U.S. labor market data boosted hopes of easing interest rates later this year. It later suffered a loss after one of its most influential stocks, Nvidia, suffered a rare stumble following a breathtaking surge that critics called overblown.\n\nFriday's decline also sent the S&P 500 into a rare week of decline, only the third in the last 19.\n\nWeakness in Nvidia and other technology stocks dragged the Nasdaq Composite Index to a market-best loss of 1.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which places less emphasis on technology, fared better. It slipped 68 points, or 0.2%.\n\nIn the bond market, Treasury yields eased following mixed data on the U.S. labor market, which economists called all-encompassing. The jobs report shows that employers hired more workers than expected last month, but workers' wages rose less than expected. He also said job growth in January was not as strong as previously thought.\n\nThe job market and the economy as a whole are in a delicate situation, where Wall Street wants them to continue to grow, but not so much as to increase pressure on inflation.\n\nThe ultimate goal is for inflation to calm down enough to convince the Federal Reserve to lower its main interest rate from its highest level since 2001. Such a move would ease pressure on the financial system and the economy. , which have so far stayed away from the recession. despite high interest rates.\n\nBig picture: These numbers were helpful for the Fed to gain confidence, said Lindsay Rosner, head of multi-sector fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nFollowing the report's release, traders' bets remained on June as the most likely starting point for Fed rate cuts. The two-year Treasury yield, which tracks Fed expectations, fell to 4.48% from 4.51% late Thursday.\n\nWall Street likes lower interest rates because they encourage people and businesses to borrow, which can strengthen the economy, and because they boost the prices of stocks and other investments.\n\nThings are good, but not great, and they're getting a little worse, Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said of the jobs report. Payroll gains are still fantastic, but haven't been as strong as we thought with previous months' numbers revised downward.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said a day earlier that the central bank was not far from cutting interest rates. He added that he just needed more data confirming that inflation was moving sustainably toward its 2% target.\n\nMeanwhile, the hope on Wall Street is that the remarkably resilient economy will boost corporate profit growth.\n\nGap rose 8.2% after the retailer reported higher profits and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The retailer said a significant sales trend has returned to growth at its Old Navy and Gap stores. The owner of Banana Republic and Athleta also gave forecasts for upcoming sales this year that were slightly higher than analysts' estimates.\n\nGun maker Smith & Wesson Brands jumped 29.4% after also reporting higher-than-expected profit for the latest quarter. He said his shipments have grown faster than the overall gun market.\n\nBut Nvidia was the main stock in the spotlight, as it fell 5.5%, its worst day since May. It's a rare occurrence for the stock, which has soared nearly 77% this year after more than tripling last year.\n\nBecause Nvidia has become the third-largest U.S. stock, it weighs much more on the S&P 500 than almost any other. That has boosted Wall Street's rise, but leaves it vulnerable to pullbacks, particularly when critics say stocks caught up in the market frenzy around artificial intelligence have climbed too far, too fast.\n\nAlso losing was Broadcom, which fell even though its results were better than expected. It fell 7% after giving revenue forecasts for the coming year that were slightly lower than analysts' expectations.\n\nCostco Wholesale fell 7.6% after its latest quarter revenue fell short of forecasts.\n\nOverall, the S&P 500 fell 33.67 points to 5,123.69. The Dow Jones fell 68.66 to 38,722.69 and the Nasdaq fell 188.26 to 16,085.11.\n\nIn overseas stock markets, indexes were mixed in Europe and rose slightly in much of Asia. South Korea stood out as the Kospi index jumped 1.2%.\n\n___\n\nAP Business writers Matt Ott and Yuri Kageyama contributed.",

    "title": "49ers Linked to Polarizing Quarterback",
    "body": "If the New England Patriots trade quarterback Mac Jones to the San Francisco 49ers, the former No. 15 pick has an outside shot to test wild hypothesis.\n\nNFL Network's James Palmer told DNVR Sports that several coaches at the NFL Combine expressed that Jones could have won multiple Lombardi Trophies with the 49ers already. The 49ers are established at quarterback with Brock Purdy after a carousel of former Patriots quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo followed by Trey Lance.\n\n\"They think if he [Kyle Shanahan] took Mac at three, they would have won multiple Super Bowls by now,\" Palmer said on the podcast.\n\nSan Francisco ironically picked before the Patriots in that 2021 draft when Lance went at No. 3 to San Francisco followed by Jones at No. 15 to New England. Lance didn't pan out, and the 49ers traded him to the Dallas Cowboys before the 2023 season.\n\nJones didn't pan out in New England as things cratered in 2023. However, the 49ers arguably offered a stronger supporting cast on offense than the Patriots during the past three seasons, which may have made the difference. Since that 2021 draft, the 49ers have reached three NFC Championship Games and one Super Bowl.\n\nIf the Patriots send Jones to San Francisco, it's likely for a late round pick. San Francisco has a potential need at backup quarterback with Sam Darnold poised to test free agency.\n\nPurdy played in all 17 games last season, but he sustained a season-ending elbow injury in the NFC Championship Game the year before. In addition, the 49ers have dealt with a plethora of quarterback injuries in recent years despite two Super Bowl appearances and four NFC title games in five years.\n\nSan Francisco could be among the teams that \"have been calling\" the Patriots about Jones. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport broke the news on Friday that the Patriots are looking at trading Jones and have been in contact with other teams.\n\nMultiple teams with quarterback needs could send a late-round pick to New England for Jones' services -- most likely as a backup. MassLive's Mark Daniels reported that a fourth or fifth round pick is realistic compensation for Jones.\n\nLas Vegas also appears poised to release Garoppolo after a PED suspension after the season. He will miss two games next fall because of the suspension.\n\nJones won't cost any of the aforementioned teams much money as he is due to make $4.95 million in 2024. The Patriots meanwhile could add depth at a needed position in exchange for Jones.",

    "title": "Analysts update Costco stock price targets after earnings",
    "body": "Not if, but when.\n\nThose words carry certainty, except for the lack of a specific time frame. The phrase could frustrate people who really want to know when exactly is when.\n\nTake the case of big-box membership-based retailer Costco (COST) , which reported fiscal-second-quarter earnings on March 7.\n\nThe Issaquah, Wash., company has added more than $100 billion in value since the lows of October last year, driven in part by resilient consumer spending on discretionary items and expanding membership fees.\n\nThe shares had hit a record early in Thursday's session, ahead of the earnings report, which came after the market closed. At last check, however, Costco's shares were sliding 6.2% to $736.72.\n\nJoe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group told Yahoo Finance it \"makes sense it would take a pause\" after the \"stock has been on fire lately.\"\n\n\"The stock also has a history of taking a breather when it reports financial news. We are not concerned, given the business remains quite solid, as evidenced by the [comparisons] trend,\" he said.\n\nThe company posted adjusted second-quarter earnings of $3.71 a share, up from $3.30 a year earlier. Revenue totaled $58.44 billion, compared with the year-ago tally of $55.3 billion.\n\nAnalysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting Costco to earn $3.63 a share on sales of $59.20 billion.\n\nCFO Galanti: 'Not on my watch'\n\nSame-store sales, excluding gasoline and foreign exchange, climbed 5.8%. In the U.S. same-store-sales growth was stronger than expected at 4.8%\n\nIn addition, Costco reported membership-fee revenue of $1.11 billion, up $84 million, or 8.2%, from a year earlier.\n\nRelated: Analysts reveal new Broadcom price targets after mixed earnings\n\nThe company has not raised its membership fees since 2017, prompting many retail analysts to wonder when Costco will get around to boosting this critical source of revenue.\n\nCostco currently charges $60 for a Gold membership and $120 for Executive, which offers a 2% cash rebate on all Costco purchases made that year.\n\nAnyone looking for an answer to the question of \"when will Costco raise membership prices?\" were probably disappointed after the company's earnings call with analysts.\n\nDuring the call, Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti stuck with the familiar \"not if, but when\" line.\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99\n\n\"We like the fact that we're performing well,\" said Galanti, who is stepping down down from his position later this month. \"We like the fact that all -- most all metrics are going in the right direction in our business right now. We've got plenty of runway left.\"\n\nGalanti insisted the company is \"not trying to be cute about it.\"\n\n\"It's not some big analytical formula,\" he said. \"It's simply a measure of, we will, at some point, I'm sure, do it.\"\n\nGalanti will be stepping down March 15 after 40 years on the job. Costco has named Gary Millerchip, previously Kroger's CFO, as his successor.\n\n\"And I've been joking with Gary. It will be on his watch, not mine,\" Galanti said.\n\nAnalysts expecting fee hike\n\nBMO Capital Markets analyst Kelly Bania picked up on the \"not when, but if\" theme in her commentary.\n\n\"Costco did not make an announcement with respect to the much anticipated membership fee hike, which may be disappointing to some at current share price levels, but a fee increase continues to be a question of when, not if,\" Bania said, according to Morningstar.\n\nMore Retail Stocks:\n\nCostco unveils executive change that could trigger membership-fee boostWalmart makes a surprise move that investors will loveAnalysts revamp Best Buy stock price targets after earnings\n\nD.A. Davidson raised the firm's price target on Costco to $680 from $600 but affirmed a neutral rating on the shares.\n\nThe stock outperformed last year and has been an outperformer year to date in 2024 as well, setting a high bar that is likely contributing to the small selloff following the results, the firm said in a research note.\n\nNo mention of a membership fee increase may also be seen as a negative \"catalyst,\" though faster \"core on core\" gross-margin gains and strong e-commerce sales were positives for the quarter, the investment firm said.\n\n\"Once again, Costco put its ability to drive traffic on display, delivering solid February and 2Q results; although operating income missed consensus,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai told investors in a research note.\n\nKatai, who raised her price target to $830 from $774 and has a buy rating on the shares, said, \"We still see a membership fee increase towards the end of FY24.\"\n\nAnd Baird raised the firm's price target on Costco to $850 from $775 while reiterating an outperform rating on the shares.\n\nWith membership Key Performance Indicators trending positively and macro dynamics seemingly settling in, the company's business is in great shape.\n\nRelated: Veteran fund manager picks favorite stocks for 2024\n\nIntro subscription only $1.99",

    "title": "Seeds collected from Sycamore Gap 'spring into life' at National Trust centre",
    "body": "Staff at the National Trust's Plant Conservation Centre have been carefully looking after the recovered seeds and twigs for the past five months.\n\nThe 300-year-old sycamore tree was felled in an act of vandalism in September which prompted national outcry. It stood in a dip in Hadrian's Wall, in Northumberland National Park, on land owned by the trust.\n\nAfter the incident, staff quickly collected material from the remains of the tree. In the months since, experts have used a range of techniques to cultivate the rescued material.\n\nAndrew Jasper, director of gardens and parklands at the National Trust, said: \"These techniques, delivered with a remarkable degree of care and precision by our conservationists, are providing a legacy for this much-loved tree.\n\n\"And while there's a way to go before we have true saplings, we'll be keeping everything crossed that these plants continue to grow stronger and can be planted out and enjoyed by many in the future.\"\n\nPictures released on Saturday showed a collection of small seedlings and buds beginning to grow.\n\nOne process known as \"grafting\" has involved joining cuttings from the tree with living twigs and rootstock of the same species to try to create genetically identical replicas of the Sycamore Gap.\n\nAnother technique known as \"budding\" has involved attaching single buds from the original tree to a rootstock.\n\nThe seeds meanwhile have been grown in a special compost mix, after being washed and checked for disease. Several dozen have now sprouted.\n\nWood from the tree has been carefully treated and is being stored under advice from experts.\n\nThe National Trust's specialist centre is home to genetic copies of some of the UK's most well-known and culturally significant plants and trees.\n\nThey include the apple tree that Sir Isaac Newton said inspired his theories on gravity, and cuttings from the Ankerwycke Yew, which is estimated to be over 2,000 years old.\n\nPlans for the Sycamore Gap seeds are still in development and saplings will not be ready for planting out for at least 12 months, the trust has said.\n\nThe organisation has been working with Northumberland National Park, Historic England and the Hadrian's Wall partnership to plan a range of responses to the tree's felling.\n\nLater this year, a programme of events including work with local schools, tree planting initiatives in Northumberland, and artistic interpretations will take place.\n\nTony Gates, chief executive officer of the Northumberland National Park Authority said: \"I was at Sycamore Gap in the immediate hours following the felling of the tree, managing the unfolding story as it happened and responding to the media.\n\n\"Whilst all of that was taking place, a team from the National Trust arrived to collect seed and other material from the tree. The seed did not appear to be mature enough and the chances of success appeared slim, but the idea of a direct link from the tree, at the time of it being felled, was a powerful one.\n\n\"How great it is that experts have been able to bring us this direct connection and refreshed hope. I look forward to working with the National Trust as we see how these beacons can send hope far beyond Northumberland. I would like to thank the team who have made this happen.\"",

    "title": "'We're hemorrhaging money': US health clinics try to stay open after unprecedented cyberattack - East Idaho News",
    "body": "(CNN) -- For more than two weeks, a cyberattack has disrupted business at health care providers across the United States, forcing small clinics to scramble to stay in business and exposing the fragility of the billing system that underpins American health care.\n\n\"We're hemorrhaging money,\" said Catherine Reinheimer, practice manager at the Foot and Ankle Specialty Center in the suburbs of Philadelphia. \"This will probably be the last week that we can keep everybody on full-time without having to do something,\" she told CNN. The center is considering taking out a loan to keep the lights on.\n\nThe cyberattack disrupted the computer networks of Change Healthcare, which serves thousands of hospitals, insurers and pharmacies nationwide. It prevented some insurance payments on prescription drugs from processing, leaving many care providers footing the bill up front and hoping to get reimbursed.\n\nChange Healthcare, part of UnitedHealth, is one of handful of companies that make up the central nervous system of the US health care market. Its services allow doctors to look up patients' insurance, pharmacies to process prescriptions, and health clinics to submit claims so they can get paid.\n\nHealth care groups have pleaded with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to offer medical practices a financial lifeline. The department on Tuesday said it was taking extraordinary steps to help get claims processed, but some care providers say it's not nearly enough.\n\nMel Davies, chief financial officer of Oregon Oncology Specialists, told CNN she is worried that the private clinic that treats 16,000 cancer patients annually could be forced to close if she doesn't get financial relief soon.\n\nCash flow has dropped by 50% in the two weeks since the cyberattack, she said. \"The magnitude of this is off the charts for us.\"\n\nOn Thursday night, half a month since the saga began, Change Healthcare announced plans to have its electronic payment platform back online by March 15 and its network for submitting claims restored the following week.\n\nBut the financial wreckage caused by the cyberattack will take a lot longer to clean up, health providers and analysts say.\n\n\"The prospect of a month or more without a restored Change Healthcare claims system emphasizes the critical need for economic assistance to physicians, including advancing funds to financially stressed medical practices,\" Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement Friday.\n\nReinheimer, who works at the foot treatment center, said Change Healthcare's plan to bringing systems back online was a \"light at the end of the tunnel ... However, it doesn't solve the immediate issue, which is lack of money today, tomorrow and next week.\"\n\nThe chaos caused by the cyberattack is prompting a reckoning for senior US cybersecurity officials about the vulnerabilities in hugely important companies that underpin the health care system.\n\nThe Change Healthcare hack \"is an evolution beyond\" other ransomware attacks on individual hospitals \"that shows the entire system is a house of cards,\" a senior US cybersecurity official told CNN.\n\nHealth care executives have been sounding the alarm for several days that the cyberattack is causing severe financial strain on the sector.\n\nThe Medical Group Management Association, which represents 15,000 medical practices, has warned of the \"devastating\" financial fallout from the hack and of \"significant cash flow problems\" facing doctors. The ransomware attack has \"had a severe ongoing impact on cancer practices and their patients,\" the nonprofit Community Oncology Alliance said this week.\n\nA week ago, Change Healthcare announced plans for a temporary loan program to get money flowing to health care providers affected by the outage.\n\nBut Richard Pollack, head of the American Hospital Association representing thousands of hospitals nationwide, slammed the proposal as \"not even a Band-Aid on the payment problems.\"\n\nThe cyberattack could end up costing Change Healthcare billions of dollars in lost revenue and clients, said Carter Groome, chief executive of cybersecurity firm First Health Advisory.\n\n\"This is a huge, huge moneymaker being essentially the middleman or the intermediary between the insurance companies,\" Groome told CNN.\n\nChange Healthcare has blamed the hack on a multinational ransomware gang called ALPHV or BlackCat that the Justice Department says has been responsible for ransomware attacks on victims around the world.\n\n>A hacker affiliated with ALPHV this week claimed that the company had paid a $22 million ransom to try to recover data stolen in the hack. Tyler Mason, a spokesperson for Change Healthcare, declined to comment when asked if the company had paid off the hackers.\n\nPrivate experts who track cryptocurrency payments said the hacking group had received a $22 million payment, but it was unclear who made the payment. \"A cryptocurrency account associated with ALPHV received a $22 million payment [on March 1],\" Ari Redbord, global head of policy at blockchain-tracing firm TRM Labs, told CNN.\n\nFor Joshua Corman, a cybersecurity expert who has focused on the health sector for years, the Change Healthcare cyberattack is clear evidence that the US health sector is not as resilient as it needs to be in a crisis.\n\nAcquisitions that have merged multibillion-dollar healthcare companies have accentuated the problem so that \"a single point of failure can have outsized, cascading reach and consequences,\" said Corman, who helped lead a federal taskforce to protect coronavirus research from hacking.\n\nIf federal officials \"don't identify the systemically important entities proactively, our adversaries will continue to do it for us ... while we burn,\" he told CNN.",

    "title": "Lufthansa promised me a refund - then closed my case",
    "body": "Gill Charlton has been fighting for Telegraph readers and solving their travel problems for more than 30 years, winning refunds, righting wrongs and suggesting solutions.\n\nHere is this week's question:\n\nOn the afternoon of Sunday December 3, my partner and I were due to fly from Munich to London with Lufthansa. However, a severe snowstorm closed Munich airport and our flight was cancelled. We were rebooked for the following day but that flight was also withdrawn.\n\nAn agent at Lufthansa's call centre told us to travel to Frankfurt by train in order to fly back to London. She booked the new flights for us and said to keep receipts for the train tickets and the hotel, as the cost would be refunded by the airline.\n\nAfter our return, we used the refund form on Lufthansa's website to submit the receipts: €223 for the train fares and €175 for the hotel. However, our claim has been refused three times and our case closed. The airline simply says that it \"cannot comply with your request for damage compensation\". Can you help?\n\n- Sophie Raymond\n\nAirlines might not like it, but they do have to look after stranded passengers when bad weather - or any other event beyond their control - leads to flight cancellations. The rights of passengers to receive care from the airline in such cases are enshrined in EC Regulation 261/2004. This says that the airline must provide - or repay the cost of - necessary meals and refreshments, overnight hotel accommodation including transport costs, and two brief phone calls.\n\nUnder their Conditions of Carriage, airlines also have to fly you on the itinerary as originally booked. If they have to change the departure or arrival airport, they must swallow the extra cost of getting you to it.\n\nUnder the 'Help' menu on its website, Lufthansa has a form headed \"Compensation and refund of expenses in the event of flight disruptions\". However, the form itself talks only about making an \"application for compensation\".\n\nI suspect that poorly trained customer services staff are conflating compensation paid for delays within the airline's control with expenses payable for weather events.\n\nI contacted Lufthansa at a higher level to get some action. I too was told at first that no compensation was payable! But the airline has now seen the light and says it is checking your invoices and will reimburse your expenses though this is \"still a work in progress\".\n\nForce majeure events do put great pressure on understaffed customer service teams. It can take months for airlines to refund expenses claims as they are checked by personnel not machines. But it is still always best to use the airline's online reclaim form to submit expenses as emails and letters sent to airlines often go unanswered these days.\n\nGill takes on a different case each week - so please send your problems to her for consideration at asktheexperts@telegraph.co.uk. Please give your full name and, if your dispute is with a travel company, your address, telephone number and any booking reference. Gill can't answer every question, but she will help where she can and all emails are acknowledged.",

    "body": "TORONTO - Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland says the federal government will cap the annual alcohol excise tax increase on beer, spirits and wine at two per cent for an additional two years.\n\nThe alcohol excise tax had been set to rise on April 1 by 4.7 per cent, tied to inflation, but Freeland announced today that the increase is being capped at the lower rate.\n\nShe also announced some tax relief for local craft breweries by cutting the excise duty rate on the first 15,000 hectolitres of beer in half for two years.\n\nShe says Canada's small craft brewers are among the finest in the world and are an important contributor to the economy.\n\nRestaurants Canada is applauding the move, saying the financial relief will give operators a chance to catch their breath as they try to cope with inflation and bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Canadian Taxpayers Federation says it is good to see some relief, but the government shouldn't be raising alcohol taxes at all.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published March 9, 2024.",

In the months since, experts have used a range of techniques to cultivate the rescued material.\n\nAndrew Jasper, director of gardens and parklands at the National Trust, said: \"These techniques, delivered with a remarkable degree of care and precision by our conservationists, are providing a legacy for this much-loved tree.\n\n\"And while there's a way to go before we have true saplings, we'll be keeping everything crossed that these plants continue to grow stronger and can be planted out and enjoyed by many in the future.\"\n\nPictures released on Saturday showed a collection of small seedlings and buds beginning to grow.\n\nOne process known as \"grafting\" has involved joining cuttings from the tree with living twigs and rootstock of the same species to try to create genetically identical replicas of the Sycamore Gap.\n\nAnother technique known as \"budding\" has involved attaching single buds from the original tree to a rootstock.\n\nThe seeds meanwhile have been grown in a special compost mix, after being washed and checked for disease.

    "body": "LARNACA: A ship laden with relief supplies for Gaza was preparing to depart Cyprus on Saturday as part of efforts to aid a population on the brink of famine.\n\nThe European Commission has said a maritime aid corridor between Cyprus and Gaza could start operating as early as this weekend in a pilot project run by an international charity and financed by the UAE.\n\nThe Open Arms, a vessel owned by a Spanish NGO and more accustomed to rescuing migrants at sea, was expected to be deployed in the first mission. It was still at the port of Larnaca in Cyprus on Saturday afternoon, live images from Reuters TV showed, and authorities could not give a precise departure time.\n\nCyprus lies about 210 miles north-west of Gaza, or about 15 hours sailing time.\n\nSeparately, the United States has said it plans to build a temporary jetty to bring aid into Gaza, which has no port infrastructure. It too plans to initially use Cyprus, which is offering a process for screening cargoes which will include Israel officials, removing the need for security checks in Gaza.\n\nNegotiations on a possible ceasefire in Israel's war against Hamas remain deadlocked.\n\nPallets of rice, flour and protein were being loaded in Larnaca on Saturday in an operation organised by the World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity and mostly funded by the UAE.\n\nAid agencies have warned of a looming famine five months into Israel's campaign against Hamas. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million inhabitants are now internally displaced, with severe bottlenecks in aid deliveries at land border checkpoints.\n\nA sea corridor from Cyprus will supplement attempts to boost aid supplies, which have included airdrops of food.\n\nThe charity WCK has partnered with Spain's Proactiva Open Arms and is sourcing the food.\n\n\"WCK and partners agree more than one ship will be needed and are working towards a constant flow of aid,\" it said in a statement, adding that another 500 tonnes of aid was ready to follow the initial shipment.\n\nA spokesperson for WCK said the intention was to sail to Gaza, where WCK and partners were building a jetty. It was not related to the U.S. jetty project.\n\nGaza has been under an Israeli navy blockade since 2007, when Hamas took control of the enclave. There have been few direct sea arrivals since then. Larnaca port was used by pro-Palestinian activists, who used small sail boats to get into Gaza harbour in 2008.",

    "title": "Seeds collected from Sycamore Gap 'spring into life' at National Trust centre",
    "body": "Seeds and buds rescued from the Sycamore Gap are \"springing into life\" at a specialist conservation centre, giving hope the famous tree will live on.\n\nStaff at the National Trust's Plant Conservation Centre have been carefully looking after the recovered seeds and twigs for the past five months.\n\nThe 300-year-old sycamore tree was felled in an act of vandalism in September which prompted national outcry. It stood in a dip in Hadrian's Wall, in Northumberland National Park, on land owned by the trust.\n\nAfter the incident, staff quickly collected material from the remains of the tree. In the months since, experts have used a range of techniques to cultivate the rescued material.\n\nAndrew Jasper, director of gardens and parklands at the National Trust, said: \"These techniques, delivered with a remarkable degree of care and precision by our conservationists, are providing a legacy for this much-loved tree.\n\n\"And while there's a way to go before we have true saplings, we'll be keeping everything crossed that these plants continue to grow stronger and can be planted out and enjoyed by many in the future.\"\n\nPictures released on Saturday showed a collection of small seedlings and buds beginning to grow.\n\nOne process known as \"grafting\" has involved joining cuttings from the tree with living twigs and rootstock of the same species to try to create genetically identical replicas of the Sycamore Gap.\n\nAnother technique known as \"budding\" has involved attaching single buds from the original tree to a rootstock.\n\nThe seeds meanwhile have been grown in a special compost mix, after being washed and checked for disease. Several dozen have now sprouted.\n\nWood from the tree has been carefully treated and is being stored under advice from experts.\n\nThe National Trust's specialist centre is home to genetic copies of some of the UK's most well-known and culturally significant plants and trees.\n\nThey include the apple tree that Sir Isaac Newton said inspired his theories on gravity, and cuttings from the Ankerwycke Yew, which is estimated to be over 2,000 years old.\n\nPlans for the Sycamore Gap seeds are still in development and saplings will not be ready for planting out for at least 12 months, the trust has said.\n\nThe organisation has been working with Northumberland National Park, Historic England and the Hadrian's Wall partnership to plan a range of responses to the tree's felling.\n\nLater this year, a programme of events including work with local schools, tree planting initiatives in Northumberland, and artistic interpretations will take place.\n\nTony Gates, chief executive officer of the Northumberland National Park Authority said: \"I was at Sycamore Gap in the immediate hours following the felling of the tree, managing the unfolding story as it happened and responding to the media.\n\n\"Whilst all of that was taking place, a team from the National Trust arrived to collect seed and other material from the tree. The seed did not appear to be mature enough and the chances of success appeared slim, but the idea of a direct link from the tree, at the time of it being felled, was a powerful one.\n\n\"How great it is that experts have been able to bring us this direct connection and refreshed hope. I look forward to working with the National Trust as we see how these beacons can send hope far beyond Northumberland. I would like to thank the team who have made this happen.\"",

    "body": "Our reader was forced to pay additional train and hotel fares after the airline cancelled their flight during a snowstorm in Munich\n\nGill Charlton has been fighting for Telegraph readers and solving their travel problems for more than 30 years, winning refunds, righting wrongs and suggesting solutions.\n\nHere is this week's question:\n\nOn the afternoon of Sunday December 3, my partner and I were due to fly from Munich to London with Lufthansa. However, a severe snowstorm closed Munich airport and our flight was cancelled. We were rebooked for the following day but that flight was also withdrawn.\n\nAn agent at Lufthansa's call centre told us to travel to Frankfurt by train in order to fly back to London. She booked the new flights for us and said to keep receipts for the train tickets and the hotel, as the cost would be refunded by the airline.\n\nAfter our return, we used the refund form on Lufthansa's website to submit the receipts: €223 for the train fares and €175 for the hotel. However, our claim has been refused three times and our case closed. The airline simply says that it \"cannot comply with your request for damage compensation\". Can you help?\n\n- Sophie Raymond\n\nDear Sophie,\n\nAirlines might not like it, but they do have to look after stranded passengers when bad weather - or any other event beyond their control - leads to flight cancellations. The rights of passengers to receive care from the airline in such cases are enshrined in EC Regulation 261/2004. This says that the airline must provide - or repay the cost of - necessary meals and refreshments, overnight hotel accommodation including transport costs, and two brief phone calls.\n\nUnder their Conditions of Carriage, airlines also have to fly you on the itinerary as originally booked. If they have to change the departure or arrival airport, they must swallow the extra cost of getting you to it.\n\nUnder the 'Help' menu on its website, Lufthansa has a form headed \"Compensation and refund of expenses in the event of flight disruptions\". However, the form itself talks only about making an \"application for compensation\".\n\nI suspect that poorly trained customer services staff are conflating compensation paid for delays within the airline's control with expenses payable for weather events.\n\nI contacted Lufthansa at a higher level to get some action. I too was told at first that no compensation was payable! But the airline has now seen the light and says it is checking your invoices and will reimburse your expenses though this is \"still a work in progress\".\n\nForce majeure events do put great pressure on understaffed customer service teams. It can take months for airlines to refund expenses claims as they are checked by personnel not machines. But it is still always best to use the airline's online reclaim form to submit expenses as emails and letters sent to airlines often go unanswered these days.\n\nYour travel problems solved\n\nGill takes on a different case each week - so please send your problems to her for consideration at asktheexperts@telegraph.co.uk. Please give your full name and, if your dispute is with a travel company, your address, telephone number and any booking reference. Gill can't answer every question, but she will help where she can and all emails are acknowledged.",

    "body": "Michigan State and Indiana have arrived at their matchup to end the regular season nowhere near where they hoped to be when the campaign started. Both the visiting Spartans and Hoosiers know there still is time to salvage what have been disappointing seasons, leaving plenty on the line Sunday at Bloomington, Ind., despite having no impact on the Big Ten regular-season title race. Michigan State was ranked No. 4 in the country in the preseason, but inconsistency and underperforming veteran players have left the Spartans simply hoping to keep alive their streak of making the NCAA Tournament. The Spartans (18-12, 10-9 Big Ten) enter after posting a 53-49 win over Northwestern on Wednesday that snapped a three-game losing streak, but their strong strength of schedule and NET ranking (No. 23 going into Friday) have them still in listed in most NCAA Tournament field projections. A road win at Indiana would go a long way to solidifying an NCAA bid, with the subsequent hope being that they can use the postseason to fulfill preseason projections. \"I still think we have some game left in us,\" Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo said. \"I think there's things we can do.\" Indiana (17-13, 9-10) has struggled all season, but enters on a three-game winning streak and playing its best basketball. The Hoosiers have beaten Wisconsin at home and won on the road at Maryland and Minnesota during the stretch. The success has coincided with the return of senior point guard Xavier Johnson, who missed six games with an elbow injury. It was also reported before the Minnesota game that head coach Mike Woodson will return next year as coach in a move that took the weight of uncertainty off the program. \"Guys are committing themselves,\" Woodson said. \"We're playing now like we should have been playing. X makes a difference, there's no doubt about that.\" --Field Level Media",

When Virgin Orbit attempted the first vertical launch from Spaceport Cornwall in January 2023, a rocket fuel filter dislodged, causing one of the engines to overheat, scuppering not only the mission but also the company, which folded soon after.\n\nThe CAA's space inspectors carry warrants giving them the authority to force companies to open up their doors for monitoring and have powers to stop or prohibit activities, and suspend or revoke licences.\n\nThere are currently three senior inspectors, supported by dozens more engineers who are also warranted and who have been recruited from the police, Border Force, the Health and Safety Executive and the aviation industry.\n\nMain focus\n\n\"The main focus is obviously safety,\" said Cuddy. \"There's other things that we look at such as national interest, national security, international obligations, that person's finance and technical resources.\n\n\"But actually what you want to do is go into an organisation and see what they are as an organisation, understand how they work, the culture. We're trying to promote safety management and learning from mistakes.\n\n\"Red flags would be people not being competent, not understanding the jobs they do. If you go into somewhere and it's a mess, for example, then I know I'm going to find things quite easily.\"\n\nCuddy began her career as an avionic engineer for British Airways, working for the company for 17 years, before moving to the CAA in 2017. In the past seven years the pace of technological change has been dramatic, and keeping up has proved challenging.\n\nSixth sense\n\nDetermining if a company is playing fast and loose has become a sixth sense based on years of experience, and is largely a matter of having the right systems in place.\n\n\"There's so much change and so much innovation and every single launch vehicle is different, and you've got different fuels and you've got different systems,\" she said.\n\n\"When I walk into an organisation, I'm on, I'm looking, and you get an immediate sense of what kind of organisation this is, what are their priorities, and whether the staff know what they are doing.\n\n\"We don't do a technical assessment of their rocket or satellite, but we look at their assessment and ask whether that seems like a reasonable argument. A satellite may have introduced a new battery, but how much history has that battery got? Has it got years of use from other organisations that proves its reliability.\n\nBigger picture\n\n\"It's not something you can teach, it's something you pick up because you've done it so many times. You are thinking back to everything you've heard, everything you've seen and how it fits into the bigger picture.\"\n\n\"It's our purpose to ensure that the processes are in place so that they could ground themselves if something happened and call it to a halt.\"\n\nSo far the team has not had to carry out enforcement and has been successfully working with operators to achieve compliance.\n\nLast December, the CAA granted a spaceport licence to the SaxaVord in Unst, Shetland, and is expected to approve its ''range'' licence in the coming weeks, which gives permission for the spaceport to clear the area around the flightpath of the rocket. Each launch operator will also require a launch licence.\n\nTest rocket\n\nEdinburgh-based aerospace firm Skyrora is scheduled to be the first to lift off from SaxaVord, and will start with a small test rocket which will reach around 65 miles high, the start of the Kármán line, which marks the boundary with space.\n\nIf successful, the company is hoping to carry out an orbital flight by the end of the year.\n\nLockheed Martin is also expected to launch its UK's Pathfinder mission from the site, while German company Rocket Factory Augsburg has already installed a rocket platform - or stool - for its first launch.\n\nRocket builder HyImpulse, which is based near Stuttgart, also announced earlier this month it was planning a programme of orbital rocket launches from SaxaVord from late 2025, with sub-orbital test flights next summer.\n\nOther spaceports across Britain, including Sutherland, Argyll and Prestwick, are also hoping to be operational by the end of the decade.",

    "title": "The US could be facing a 2008-style financial crisis. Why does Sunak want to copy it? | Economics - Today Headline",
    "body": "One of the consistent themes of the Conservative economic narrative is an admiration for the US and its ability to grow quickly. The way it has bounced back from the pandemic and how it has ridden out the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine should serve as a blueprint.\n\nA neoliberal Conservative analysis puts the emphasis on tech, innovation and a myth-like entrepreneurial spirit that the UK would do well to emulate. What it ignores is the way the US economy zips ahead on fantastical stock market valuations and off-balance-sheet accounting reminiscent of the years before the 2008 financial crisis. And how both these habits could bite back in a big way, much as they did in 2008, and pretty soon.\n\nWhile Europe wrestles in a largely transparent fashion with the fallout of deindustrialisation and an ageing workforce with high levels of welfare and state subsidies (giving rightwing commentators all the ammunition they need to knock slow-moving social democratic societies), the US hides many of its problems.\n\nOne of those costs is a looming insurance crisis chronicled by analysts at Bloomberg. It is an off-balance-sheet exercise that ranks alongside student loans and public service pensions for its sheer size, but outranks them for the nightmarish instability of the whole scheme.\n\nThe financial data provider has documented the switch by millions of homeowners from private insurers to a \"last resort\" state-run insurer in areas affected by the climate crisis and the hurricanes, wildfires and floods that rising temperatures bring. Those plans have more than doubled their market share since 2018, and their liabilities crossed the $1tn threshold for the first time in 2022, according to Property Insurance Plans Service Office, a research company that tracks the programmes.\n\nCritics of the way private insurers have offloaded liabilities worry that even a modest wave of claims in any of these states will overwhelm the finances of the scheme. Still, one could argue that when this happens, it will be the US government that picks up the tab, keeping a bad problem relatively self-contained.\n\nA looming banking crisis may not be so easy to stop at the border. Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that US banks were at risk from the impact of high interest rates on the value of commercial property.\n\nOffice blocks that have seen their value soar in the last 15 years are now seriously underwater, financially speaking. Analysts have been worried for some time about the huge liabilities on bank balance sheets, but the lack of demand for office space, as a result of the trend for working from home, means a crisis is now imminent.\n\nWe all remember how the sub-prime residential property markets of California, Florida and many other US states became a bubble after several years of aggressive mortgage selling to people with low incomes. It burst, triggering the 2008 financial crisis, after a series of interest rate rises meant the mortgages were unaffordable and owners handed back the keys.\n\nThe IMF said a \"sizable subgroup\" of banks were in trouble, \"with fears that the failure of one institution could precipitate a broader loss of confidence in the sector\".\n\nIt added: \"Beyond the unrealised losses due to higher interest, the credit risk carried by some institutions, particularly their exposure to corporate real estate, is at the centre stage of investors' fears today.\"\n\nStaff at the credit rating agency S&P have also signalled concerns about high interest rates, though they make a separate point, saying rising debt bills could trigger a wave of corporate failures in the US next year. At a recent briefing, some of the agency's analysts said thousands of companies had hedged their interest rate exposure, betting that they could refinance when rates fell back. What if rates only tick down gently? These companies will find their loans unaffordable and go bust.\n\nCentral bank governors in the US, eurozone and UK are expected to cut the cost of borrowing slowly this year. Possibly too slowly.\n\nAnother concern is the exuberance seen in US stock markets. Could it be that increases in share values over the last two years, pushing the US S&P 500 to a record high, constitute a speculative bubble and a rout is imminent?\n\nA great admirer of the US, Rishi Sunak appears to believe the UK would be well placed sitting in Washington's slipstream. That means loosening the constraints on financial companies and banks, letting them join the dash for profit, while running down the capacity of public services, including health.\n\nIt also means becoming more dependent on foreign investment and imports of essential goods from countries that have lax health and safety laws, weaker workers' rights and more autocratic or unstable governments.\n\nWhatever kind of potential shock you care to think about - health, financial or trade - the UK is becoming more, not less, vulnerable.",

    "title": "Egypt floats its currency and agrees with the IMF to increase a bailout loan to $8 billion",
    "body": "CAIRO (AP) -- Egypt on Wednesday floated its currency and announced a deal with the International Monetary Fund to increase its bailout loan from $3 billion to $8 billion, moving to shore up an economy hit by a staggering shortage of foreign currency and soaring inflation.\n\nThe flotation of the Egyptian pound, combined with a sharp raise of the main interest rate, is meant to combat inflationary waves and attract foreign investment. The measures, announced by the Central Bank of Egypt early Wednesday, were among the key demands of the IMF to increase its $3 billion bailout loan that both parties agreed to in 2022. The central bank, known as CBE, increased the key interest rate by 600 basis points to 27.75%.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the pound began floating and within hours lost more than 60% of its value against the dollar. By the end of the day, commercial banks were trading the U.S. currency at more than 50 pounds for $1, up from about 31 pounds.\n\nThe value of a floating currency is determined each day by traders in global markets, rather than by government policies. In that way, a floating currency imposes discipline: Investors tend to buy the currency of a nation with prudent economic policies, driving up its value.\n\nConversely, the market typically shuns the currencies of poorly managed economies, keeping their value low. It often punishes countries that run up huge deficits or that recklessly print money and stoke inflation. Black markets emerge when a government fixes the value of its currency above what the market thinks it's worth, which is what happened in Egypt.\n\nThe Egyptian economy has been hit hard by years of government austerity, the coronavirus pandemic, the fallout from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and most recently, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthi attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea have slashed Suez Canal revenues, which is a major source for foreign currency. The attacks forced traffic away from the canal and around the tip of Africa.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, which rattled the global economy, hit cash-strapped Egypt where it is financially vulnerable -- the most populous Arab country is the world's biggest importer of wheat and needs to buy a majority of its food from other countries to help feed its population of more than 104 million people.\n\nThe CBE said that its measures Wednesday would help end the black market in currencies and slow inflation, which reached unprecedented levels in recent months. The annual inflation rate was more than 31% in January, according to official figures.\n\n\"The CBE will continue to target inflation as its nominal anchor, allowing the exchange rate to be determined by market forces,\" the central bank said.\n\nThe authorities also said the CBE has managed to \"secure funds\" for market needs -- an indication they expected the exchange rate to stabilize.\n\n\"We have sufficient foreign currency to cover our obligations, particularly after the unification of the exchange rate,\" central bank Gov. Hassan Abdalla told a news conference. He said the CBE will focus on slowing down two-digit inflation.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take any measures to fight inflation,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts believe the source of the funds was a multibillion dollar deal last week with an Emirati consortium to jointly develop the Mediterranean city of Ras el-Hekma, 350 kilometers (about 220 miles) northwest of Cairo. Egypt will get $35 billion from that deal.\n\nThe rising cost of basic goods has deepened the hardships faced by middle-class and poor Egyptians. They have suffered from price hikes since the government embarked on an ambitious reform program in 2016 to overhaul the battered economy. Nearly 30% of Egyptians live in poverty, according to official figures.\n\nThe new devaluation and interest rate hike will inflict further pain on Egyptians already struggling with soaring prices, said Hamish Kinnear, senior analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.\n\nThe central bank measures paved the way for an agreement with the IMF to increase a bailout loan to $8 billion, up from $3 billion after marathon negotiations. The agreement, announced late Wednesday afternoon, still needs the approval of the IMF executive board, which is expected to meet this month.\n\n\"The authorities are showing strong commitment to act promptly on all critical aspects of their economic reform program,\" said Ivanna Vladkova Hollar, IMF mission chief for Egypt, adding that the main reforms include a free-floating exchange rate and a slowdown in infrastructure spending to reduce inflation.\n\nEgyptian Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly said the new deal would enable the government to receive loans from other financial institutions, including the World Bank.\n\n___\n\nAP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "body": "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Max Verstappen stayed firmly on course for another season of dominance in Formula 1 on Saturday by winning the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\n\nEven after just two races, and despite turmoil at Red Bull, Verstappen seems in near-total control on the track as he aims for a fourth consecutive title this year.\n\n\"A fantastic weekend for the whole team and also for myself. I felt really good with the car,\" Verstappen said.\n\nThe Dutch driver won easily ahead of his teammate Sergio Perez. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was third.\n\n\"It was a bit of a boring race because Red Bull were a bit too quick and behind we had a bit of a gap, but we took the maximum points we could today,\" Leclerc said.\n\nVerstappen started on pole and held off Leclerc at the first corner, as he did last week at the season-opener in Bahrain which he won, before quickly building his lead.\n\nThe only interruption came when Lance Stroll's crash brought out the safety car. Verstappen came into the pits for a tire change and after the restart easily passed Lando Norris - who hadn't stopped - to retake the lead.\n\nPerez had a five-second penalty because Red Bull released him from a pit stop into the path of another car, but that didn't matter since he finished far ahead of Leclerc.\n\nEighteen-year-old British driver Oliver Bearman was seventh for Ferrari in his first F1 race, one day after being called up as an emergency replacement for Carlos Sainz Jr., who needed an operation to treat appendicitis.\n\nOscar Piastri took fourth for McLaren, with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso fifth and George Russell sixth for Mercedes.\n\nBehind Bearman in seventh, McLaren's Lando Norris held off Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in a fight for eighth place. Nico Hulkenberg was 10th for Haas' first point in F1 since the Singapore Grand Prix in September.\n\nVerstappen's second win of the season followed speculation over his future at Red Bull.\n\nVerstappen had suggested Friday that he might reconsider his relationship with the team if his mentor Helmut Marko were to leave Red Bull, but Marko told German broadcaster Sky Sport on Saturday that he was staying.\n\nThe team's parent company last week dismissed a complaint of alleged misconduct by Red Bull team principal Horner toward a team employee.",

    "title": "Max Verstappen cruises to victory at Saudi Arabian GP to extend dominant start to F1 title defense",
    "body": "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Max Verstappen stayed firmly on course for another season of dominance in Formula 1 on Saturday by winning the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.\n\nEven after just two races, and despite turmoil at Red Bull, Verstappen seems in near-total control on the track as he aims for a fourth consecutive title this year.\n\n\"A fantastic weekend for the whole team and also for myself. I felt really good with the car,\" Verstappen said.\n\nThe Dutch driver won easily ahead of his teammate Sergio Perez. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc was third.\n\n\"It was a bit of a boring race because Red Bull were a bit too quick and behind we had a bit of a gap, but we took the maximum points we could today,\" Leclerc said.\n\nVerstappen started on pole and held off Leclerc at the first corner, as he did last week at the season-opener in Bahrain which he won, before quickly building his lead.\n\nThe only interruption came when Lance Stroll's crash brought out the safety car. Verstappen came into the pits for a tire change and after the restart easily passed Lando Norris -- who hadn't stopped -- to retake the lead.\n\nPerez had a five-second penalty because Red Bull released him from a pit stop into the path of another car, but that didn't matter since he finished far ahead of Leclerc.\n\nEighteen-year-old British driver Oliver Bearman was seventh for Ferrari in his first F1 race, one day after being called up as an emergency replacement for Carlos Sainz Jr., who needed an operation to treat appendicitis.\n\nOscar Piastri took fourth for McLaren, with Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso fifth and George Russell sixth for Mercedes.\n\nBehind Bearman in seventh, McLaren's Lando Norris held off Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in a fight for eighth place. Nico Hulkenberg was 10th for Haas' first point in F1 since the Singapore Grand Prix in September.\n\nVerstappen's second win of the season followed speculation over his future at Red Bull.\n\nVerstappen had suggested Friday that he might reconsider his relationship with the team if his mentor Helmut Marko were to leave Red Bull, but Marko told German broadcaster Sky Sport on Saturday that he was staying.\n\nThe team's parent company last week dismissed a complaint of alleged misconduct by Red Bull team principal Horner toward a team employee.\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

    "body": "A company that worked on the ArriveCan app is defending its integrity and asserts steps were taken to address conflict-of-interest concerns related to its founder, who recently went to work for the Department of National Defence.\n\nDalian Enterprises Inc. said David Yeo made the appropriate conflict-of-interest filing, resigned as a director and officer and put his company shares in a blind trust since its main customer is the government of Canada.\n\nYeo also agreed not to participate in any direct or indirect work that the company was doing for the Defence Department, said a spokesperson for the company.\n\nThe spokesperson said in a statement that from 2002 until September 2023, Yeo, a former military member, \"was not an employee of the government of Canada in any capacity.\"\n\nHe \"only provided IT professional services on a contract basis through Dalian to the Department of National Defence,\" the statement said.\n\nIt's the first time the company has publicly responded after CTV News reported last month on Yeo's employment status and Dalian's previous work on ArriveCan. The government paid the company $7.9 million as part of the app's nearly $60-million overall cost.\n\nFollowing that report, the Defence Department announced that Yeo was suspended and that it had launched an internal investigation.\n\nA week ago, Public Services and Procurement Canada announced it was suspending the company's security status \"in response to information that recently came to light.\"\n\nIt said that the company would no longer be able to work on federal contracts or participate in new procurement opportunities.\n\nREAD MORE: Info watchdog probing record destruction allegations related to ArriveCan app\n\nOn Friday, the Defence Department would only say the investigation is still ongoing.\n\nDalian's spokesperson said Yeo would not be available for an interview.\n\nWhen he began working for the government in September, the company's work for ArriveCan had long since concluded, the spokesperson said.\n\nDalian, along with Coradix Technology Consulting, were authorized in August of 2019 to work on various Canada Border Services Agency projects.\n\nThat later included the ArriveCan app, which has since fallen under intense scrutiny for its bloated cost.\n\nCoradix has also been suspended from government work.\n\nWhen Yeo testified before a House of Commons committee in October, he spoke to his integrity. He didn't mention his current employment and wasn't asked about it.\n\n\"During my 36-year career with the Canadian army, which included deployments to Afghanistan and the Middle East, I was held to the highest levels of integrity, and of course, I continue to conduct myself in this manner today,\" Yeo said.\n\nHe was recently invited to speak to the committee again, after the department announced its investigation.\n\nEarlier this week, Canada's auditor General Karen Hogan told MPs at a committee hearing about Yeo's connection to the Department of National Defence.\n\nShe said that connection wasn't detected as part of her audit of the ArriveCan project because the Defence Department was not involved in the development of the app.\n\nBut she said employees' full disclosure is \"essential\" so that supervisors can assess if any outside work is incompatible with the person's job, and \"whether it might have an impact on their ability to carry out their duties in an objective and fair manner.\"\n\n\"The disclosure is maybe not always happening, and when the disclosure happens you can take the measures that you need,\" Hogan said.\n\nHogan said there have been times in her own office when employees disclosed certain information and their employer is \"fine with it.\" Other times, that's not the case. But it's up to the supervisor to decide, she said.\n\nThe Treasury Board Secretariat said on Friday it does not have centralized records on the number of government of Canada employees that are engaged in outside employment.\n\nDalian said since the company was founded in 2002, it has been regularly audited by what is now known as Indigenous Services Canada.\n\nThat department oversees compliance requirements for Indigenous-owned businesses when it comes to certain procurement opportunities.\n\n\"In the most recent such audit, conducted December 2023 to February 2024, ISC confirmed that Dalian successfully met (Procurement Strategy for Indigenous Business) criteria,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMickey Djuric, The Canadian Press",
